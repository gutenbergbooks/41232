</div>

<h2 class="no-page-break">WINGS</h2>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">My</span> heart chokes in me like in a prison! I’m
dying for a little love and I got nobody&mdash;nobody!”
wailed Shenah Pessah, as she looked out
of the dismal basement window.</p>

<p>It was a bright Sunday afternoon in May,
and into the gray, cheerless, janitor’s basement
a timid ray of sunlight announced the
dawn of spring.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! Light!” breathed Shenah Pessah,
excitedly, throwing open the sash. “A little
light in the room for the first time!” And she
stretched out her hands hungrily for the warming
bit of sun.</p>

<p>The happy laughter of the shopgirls standing
on the stoop with their beaux and the sight of the
young mothers with their husbands and babies
fanned anew the consuming fire in her breast.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>“I’m not jealous!” she gasped, chokingly.
“My heart hurts too deep to want to tear
from them their luck to happiness. But why
should they live and enjoy life and why must
I only <em>look on</em> how they are happy?”</p>

<p>She clutched at her throat like one stifled
for want of air. “What is the matter with you?
Are you going out of your head? For what is
your crying? Who will listen to you? Who
gives a care what’s going to become from
you?”</p>

<p>Crushed by her loneliness, she sank into a
chair. For a long time she sat motionless, finding
drear fascination in the mocking faces traced
in the patches of the torn plaster. Gradually,
she became aware of a tingling warmth playing
upon her cheeks. And with a revived breath,
she drank in the miracle of the sunlit wall.</p>

<p>“Ach!” she sighed. “Once a year the sun
comes to light up even this dark cellar, so why
shouldn’t the High One send on me too a little
brightness?”</p>

<p>This new wave of hope swept aside the fact
that she was the “greenhorn” janitress, that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>
she was twenty-two and dowryless, and, according
to the traditions of her people, condemned
to be shelved aside as an unmated
thing&mdash;a creature of pity and ridicule.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it how old I am or how poor I
am!” she burst out to the deaf and dumb air.
“I want a little life! I want a little joy!”</p>

<p>The bell rang sharply, and as she turned to
answer the call, she saw a young man at the
doorway&mdash;a framed picture of her innermost
dreams.</p>

<p>The stranger spoke.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah did not hear the words, she
heard only the music of his voice. She gazed
fascinated at his clothes&mdash;the loose Scotch
tweeds, the pongee shirt, a bit open at the neck,
but she did not see him or the things he wore.
She only felt an irresistible presence seize her
soul. It was as though the god of her innermost
longings had suddenly taken shape in human
form and lifted her in mid-air.</p>

<p>“Does the janitor live here?” the stranger
repeated.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah nodded.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>“Can you show me the room to let?”</p>

<p>“Yes, right away, but wait only a minute,”
stammered Shenah Pessah, fumbling for the
key on the shelf.</p>

<p>“Don’t fly into the air!” She tried to reason
with her wild, throbbing heart, as she walked
upstairs with him. In an effort to down the
chaos of emotion that shook her she began to
talk nervously: “Mrs. Stein who rents out the
room ain’t going to be back till the evening,
but I can tell you the price and anything you
want to know. She’s a grand cook and you can
eat by her your breakfast and dinner&mdash;” She
did not have the slightest notion of what she
was saying, but talked on in a breathless stream
lest he should hear the loud beating of her heart.</p>

<p>“Could I have a drop-light put in here?”
the man asked, as he looked about the room.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah stole a quick, shy glance at
him. “Are you maybe a teacher or a writing
man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes I teach,” he said, studying
her, drawn by the struggling soul of her that
cried aloud to him out of her eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>“I could tell right away that you must be
some kind of a somebody,” she said, looking up
with wistful worship in her eyes. “Ach, how
grand it must be to live only for learning and
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Is this your home?”</p>

<p>“I never had a home since I was eight years
old. I was living by strangers even in Russia.”</p>

<p>“Russia?” he repeated with quickened attention.
So he was in their midst, the people he
had come to study. The girl with her hungry
eyes and intense eagerness now held a new interest
for him.</p>

<p>John Barnes, the youngest instructor of
sociology in his university, congratulated himself
at his good fortune in encountering such a
splendid type for his research. He was preparing
his thesis on the “Educational Problems of
the Russian Jews,” and in order to get into
closer touch with his subject, he had determined
to live on the East Side during his spring and
summer vacation.</p>

<p>He went on questioning her, unconsciously
using all the compelling power that made people
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
open their hearts to him. “And how long have
you been here?”</p>

<p>“Two years already.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be fond of study. I suppose
you go to night-school?”</p>

<p>“I never yet stepped into a night-school
since I came to America. From where could I
get the time? My uncle is such an old man he
can’t do much and he got already used to leave
the whole house on me.”</p>

<p>“You stay with your uncle, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my uncle sent for me the ticket for
America when my aunt was yet living. She got
herself sick. And what could an old man like
him do with only two hands?”</p>

<p>“Was that sufficient reason for you to leave
your homeland?”</p>

<p>“What did I have out there in Savel that I
should be afraid to lose? The cows that I used
to milk had it better than me. They got at
least enough to eat and me slaving from morning
till night went around hungry.”</p>

<p>“You poor child!” broke from the heart of
the man, the scientific inquisition of the sociologist
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
momentarily swept away by his human
sympathy.</p>

<p>Who had ever said “poor child” to her&mdash;and
in such a voice? Tears gathered in Shenah
Pessah’s eyes. For the first time she mustered
the courage to look straight at him. The man’s
face, his voice, his bearing, so different from
any one she had ever known, and yet what was
there about him that made her so strangely
at ease with him? She went on talking, led
irresistibly by the friendly glow in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I got yet a lot of luck. I learned myself
English from a Jewish English reader, and one
of the boarders left me a grand book. When I
only begin to read, I forget I’m on this world.
It lifts me on wings with high thoughts.” Her
whole face and figure lit up with animation as
she poured herself out to him.</p>

<p>“So even in the midst of these sordid surroundings
were ‘wings’ and ‘high thoughts,’”
he mused. Again the gleam of the visionary&mdash;the
eternal desire to reach out and up, which
was the predominant racial trait of the Russian
immigrant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>“What is the name of your book?” he continued,
taking advantage of this providential
encounter.</p>

<p>“The book is ‘Dreams,’ by Olive Schreiner.”</p>

<p>“H&mdash;m,” he reflected. “So these are the
‘wings’ and ‘high thoughts.’ No wonder the
blushes&mdash;the tremulousness. What an opportunity
for a psychological test-case, and at
the same time I could help her by pointing the
way out of her nebulous emotionalism and
place her feet firmly on earth.” He made a
quick, mental note of certain books that he
would place in her hands and wondered how
she would respond to them.</p>

<p>“Do you belong to a library?”</p>

<p>“Library? How? Where?”</p>

<p>Her lack of contact with Americanizing
agencies appalled him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to introduce you to the library
when I come to live here,” he said.</p>

<p>“<ins title="Ci">Oi</ins>-i! You really like it, the room?” Shenah
Pessah clapped her hands in a burst of uncontrollable
delight.</p>

<p>“I like the room very much, and I shall be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
glad to take it if you can get it ready for me by
next week.”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah looked up at the man. “Do
you mean it? You really want to come and
live here, in this place? The sky is falling to the
earth!”</p>

<p>“Live here?” Most decidedly he would live
here. He became suddenly enthusiastic. But
it was the enthusiasm of the scientist for
the specimen of his experimentation&mdash;of the
sculptor for the clay that would take form
under his touch.</p>

<p>“I’m coming here to live&mdash;” He was surprised
at the eager note in his voice, the sudden
leaven of joy that surged through his veins.
“And I’m going to teach you to read sensible
books, the kind that will help you more than
your dream book.”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah drank in his words with a joy
that struck back as fear lest this man&mdash;the
visible sign of her answered prayer&mdash;would
any moment be snatched up and disappear in
the heavens where he belonged. With a quick
leap toward him she seized his hand in both
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
her own. “Oi, mister! Would you like to learn
me English lessons too? I’ll wash for you your
shirts for it. If you would even only talk to me,
it would be more to me than all the books in
the world.”</p>

<p>He instinctively recoiled at this outburst of
demonstrativeness. His eyes narrowed and his
answer was deliberate. “Yes, you ought to
learn English,” he said, resuming his professional
tone, but the girl was too overwrought to
notice the change in his manner.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he thought to himself on his
way out. “The whole gamut of the Russian
Jew&mdash;the pendulum swinging from abject
servility to boldest aggressiveness.”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah remained standing and smiling
to herself after Mr. Barnes left. She did not
remember a thing she had said. She only felt
herself whirling in space, millions of miles beyond
the earth. The god of dreams had arrived
and nothing on earth could any longer
hold her down.</p>

<p>Then she hurried back to the basement and
took up the broken piece of mirror that stood
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
on the shelf over the sink and gazed at her
face trying to see herself through his eyes.
“Was it only pity that made him stop to talk to
me? Or can it be that he saw what’s inside me?”</p>

<p>Her eyes looked inward as she continued to
talk to herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>“God from the world!” she prayed. “I’m
nothing and nobody now, but ach! How beautiful
I would become if only the light from his
eyes would fall on me!”</p>

<p>Covering her flushed face with her hands as
if to push back the tumult of desire that surged
within her, she leaned against the wall. “Who
are you to want such a man?” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“But no one is too low to love God, the
Highest One. There is no high in love and
there is no low in love. Then why am I too low
to love him?”</p>

<p>“Shenah Pessah!” called her uncle angrily.
“What are you standing there like a yok,
dreaming in the air? Don’t you hear the tenants
knocking on the pipes? They are hollering for
the hot water. You let the fire go out.”</p>

<p>At the sound of her uncle’s voice all her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
“high thoughts” fled. The mere reminder of
the furnace with its ashes and cinders smothered
her buoyant spirits and again she was
weighed down by the strangling yoke of her
hateful, daily round.</p>

<p>It was evening when she got through with
her work. To her surprise she did not feel any
of the old weariness. It was as if her feet danced
under her. Then from the open doorway of
their kitchen she overheard Mrs. Melker, the
matchmaker, talking to her uncle.</p>

<p>“Motkeh, the fish-peddler, is looking for a
wife to cook him his eating and take care on
his children,” she was saying in her shrill,
grating voice. “So I thought to myself this is a
golden chance for Shenah Pessah to grab. You
know a girl in her years and without money,
a single man wouldn’t give a look on her.”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah shuddered. She wanted to
run away from the branding torture of their
low talk, but an unreasoning curiosity drew
her to listen.</p>

<p>“Living is so high,” went on Mrs. Melker,
“that single men don’t want to marry themselves
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
even to <em>young</em> girls, except if they can
get themselves into a family with money to
start them up in business. It is Shenah Pessah’s
luck yet that Motkeh likes good eating and he
can’t stand it any more the meals in a restaurant.
He heard from people what a good cook
and housekeeper Shenah Pessah is, so he sent
me around to tell you he would take her as she
stands without a cent.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Melker dramatically beat her breast.
“I swear I shouldn’t live to go away from here
alive, I shouldn’t live to see my own children
married if I’m talking this match for the few
dollars that Motkeh will pay me for it, but because
I want to do something good for a poor
orphan. I’m a mother, and it weeps in me my
heart to see a girl in her years and not married.”</p>

<p>“And who’ll cook for me my eating, if I’ll
let her go?” broke out her uncle angrily. “And
who’ll do me my work? Didn’t I spend out
fifty dollars to send for her the ticket to America?
Oughtn’t I have a little use from her for
so many dollars I laid out on her?”</p>

<p>“Think on God!” remonstrated Mrs. Melker.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
“The girl is an orphan and time is pushing itself
on her. Do you want her to sit till her braids
grow gray, before you’ll let her get herself a
man? It stands in the Talmud that a man
should take the last bite away from his mouth
to help an orphan get married. You’d beg yourself
out a place in heaven in the next world&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In America a person can’t live on hopes for
the next world. In America everybody got to
look out for himself. I’d have to give up the
janitor’s work to let her go, and then where
would I be?”</p>

<p>“You lived already your life. Give her also a
chance to lift up her head in the world. Couldn’t
you get yourself in an old man’s home?”</p>

<p>“These times you got to have money even in
an old man’s home. You know how they say,
if you oil the wheels you can ride. With dry
hands you can’t get nothing in America.”</p>

<p>“So you got no pity on an orphan and your
own relation? All her young years she choked
herself in darkness and now comes already a
little light for her, a man that can make a
good living wants her&mdash;”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>“And who’ll have pity on me if I’ll let her
out from my hands? Who is this Motkeh, anyway?
Is he good off? Would I also have a place
where to lay my old head? Where stands he out
with his pushcart?”</p>

<p>“On Essex Street near Delancey.”</p>

<p>“Oi-i! You mean Motkeh Pelz? Why, I know
him yet from years ago. They say his wife died
him from hunger. She had to chew the earth
before she could beg herself out a cent from him.
By me Shenah Pessah has at least enough to
eat and shoes on her feet. I ask you only is it
worth already to grab a man if you got to die
from hunger for it?”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah could listen no longer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry yourself for me,” she commanded,
charging into the room. “Don’t take
pity on my years. I’m living in America, not
in Russia. I’m not hanging on anybody’s neck
to support me. In America, if a girl earns her
living, she can be fifty years old and without a
man, and nobody pities her.”</p>

<p>Seizing her shawl, she ran out into the street.
She did not know where her feet carried her.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
She had only one desire&mdash;to get away. A
fierce rebellion against everything and everybody
raged within her and goaded her on until
she felt herself choked with hate.</p>

<p>All at once she visioned a face and heard a
voice. The blacker, the more stifling the ugliness
of her prison, the more luminous became
the light of the miraculous stranger who had
stopped for a moment to talk to her. It was as
though inside a pit of darkness the heavens
opened and hidden hopes began to sing.</p>

<p>Her uncle was asleep when she returned. In
the dim gaslight she looked at his yellow, care-crushed
face with new compassion in her heart.
“Poor old man!” she thought, as she turned to
her room. “Nothing beautiful never happened
to him. What did he have in life outside the
worry for bread and rent? Who knows, maybe
if such a god of men would have shined on
him&mdash;” She fell asleep and she awoke with
visions opening upon visions of new, gleaming
worlds of joy and hope. She leaped out of bed
singing a song she had not heard since she was
a little child in her mother’s home.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>Several times during the day, she found herself,
at the broken mirror, arranging and rearranging
her dark mass of unkempt hair with
fumbling fingers. She was all a-tremble with
breathless excitement to imitate the fluffy
style of the much-courted landlady’s daughter.</p>

<p>For the first time she realized how shabby
and impossible her clothes were. “Oi weh!” she
wrung her hands. “I’d give away everything in
the world only to have something pretty to
wear for him. My whole life hangs on how I’ll
look in his eyes. I got to have a hat and a new
dress. I can’t no more wear my ‘greenhorn’
shawl going out with an American.</p>

<p>“But from where can I get the money for new
clothes? Oi weh! How bitter it is not to have the
dollar! Woe is me! No mother, no friend, nobody
to help me lift myself out of my greenhorn
rags.”</p>

<p>“Why not pawn the feather bed your mother
left you?” She jumped at the thought.</p>

<p>“What? Have you no heart? No feelings?
Pawn the only one thing left from your dead
mother?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>“Why not? Nothing is too dear for him. If
your mother could stand up from her grave,
she’d cut herself in pieces, she’d tear the sun
and stars out from the sky to make you beautiful
for him.”</p>

<p>Late one evening Zaretsky sat in his pawnshop,
absorbed in counting the money of his
day’s sales, when Shenah Pessah, with a shawl
over her head and a huge bundle over her shoulder,
edged her way hesitantly into the store.
Laying her sacrifice down on the counter, she
stood dumbly and nervously fingered the fringes
of her shawl.</p>

<p>The pawnbroker lifted his miserly face from
the cash-box and shot a quick glance at the
girl’s trembling figure.</p>

<p>“Nu?” said Zaretsky, in his cracked voice,
cutting the twine from the bundle and unfolding
a feather bed. His appraising hand felt that
it was of the finest down. “How much ask you
for it?”</p>

<p>The fiendish gleam of his shrewd eyes paralyzed
her with terror. A lump came in her throat
and she wavered speechless.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>“I’ll give you five dollars,” said Zaretsky.</p>

<p>“Five dollars?” gasped Shenah Pessah. Her
hands rushed back anxiously to the feather bed
and her fingers clung to it as if it were a living
thing. She gazed panic-stricken at the gloomy
interior of the pawnshop with its tawdry jewels
in the cases; the stacks of second-hand clothing
hanging overhead, back to the grisly face of the
pawnbroker. The weird tickings that came from
the cheap clocks on the shelves behind Zaretsky,
seemed to her like the smothered heart-beats of
people who like herself had been driven to barter
their last precious belongings for a few dollars.</p>

<p>“Is it for yourself that you come?” he asked,
strangely stirred by the mute anguish in the
girl’s eyes. This morgue of dead belongings had
taken its toll of many a pitiful victim of want.
But never before had Zaretsky been so affected.
People bargained and rebelled and struggled
with him on his own plane. But the dumb helplessness
of this girl and her coming to him at
such a late hour touched the man’s heart.</p>

<p>“Is it for yourself?” he repeated, in a softened
tone.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>The new note of feeling in his voice made her
look up. The hard, crafty expression on his face
had given place to a look of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s mine, from my mother,” she stammered,
brokenly. “The last memory from Russia.
How many winters it took my mother to
pick together the feathers. She began it when I
was yet a little baby in the cradle&mdash;and&mdash;”
She covered her face with her shawl and sobbed.</p>

<p>“Any one sick? Why do you got to pawn it?”</p>

<p>She raised her tear-stained face and mutely
looked at him. How could she explain and how
could he possibly understand her sudden savage
desire for clothes?</p>

<p>Zaretsky, feeling that he had been clumsy and
tactless, hastened to add, “Nu&mdash;I’ll give you&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;ten
dollars,” he finished with a
motion of his hand, as if driving from him the
onrush of generosity that seized him.</p>

<p>“Oi, mister!” cried Shenah Pessah, as the
man handed her the bill. “You’re saving me
my life! God will pay you for this goodness.”
And crumpling the money in her hand, she
hurried back home elated.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>The following evening, as soon as her work
was over, Shenah Pessah scurried through the
ghetto streets, seeking in the myriad-colored
shop windows the one hat and the one dress
that would voice the desire of her innermost
self. At last she espied a shining straw with
cherries so red, so luscious, that they cried out
to her, “Bite me!” That was the hat she bought.</p>

<p>The magic of those cherries on her hat
brought back to her the green fields and orchards
of her native Russia. Yes, a green dress
was what she craved. And she picked out the
greenest, crispest organdie.</p>

<p>That night, as she put on her beloved colors,
she vainly tried to see herself from head to foot,
but the broken bit of a mirror that she owned
could only show her glorious parts of her. Her
clothes seemed to enfold her in flames of desire
leaping upon desire. “Only to be beautiful!
Only to be beautiful!” she murmured breathlessly.
“Not for myself, but only for him.”</p>

<p>Time stood still for Shenah Pessah as she
counted the days, the hours, and the minutes
for the arrival of John Barnes. At last, through
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
her basement window, she saw him walk up the
front steps. She longed to go over to him and
fling herself at his feet and cry out to him with
what hunger of heart she awaited his coming.
But the very intensity of her longing left her
faint and dumb.</p>

<p>He passed to his room. Later, she saw him
walk out without even stopping to look at her.
The next day and the day after, she watched
him from her hidden corner pass in and out of
the house, but still he did not come to her.</p>

<p>Oh, how sweet it was to suffer the very hurt
of his oblivion of her! She gloried in his great
height that made him so utterly unaware of her
existence. It was enough for her worshiping
eyes just to glimpse him from afar. What was
she to him? Could she expect him to greet the
stairs on which he stepped? Or take notice of the
door that swung open for him? After all, she was
nothing but part of the house. So why should
he take notice of her? She was the steps on
which he walked. She was the door that swung
open for him. And he did not know it.</p>

<p>For four evenings in succession, ever since
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
John Barnes had come to live in the house, Shenah
Pessah arrayed herself in her new things and
waited. Was it not a miracle that he came the
first time when she did not even dream that he
was on earth? So why shouldn’t the miracle
happen again? This evening, however, she was so
spent with the hopelessness of her longing that
she had no energy left to put on her adornments.</p>

<p>All at once she was startled out of her apathy
by a quick tap on her window-pane. “How
about going to the library, to-morrow evening?”
asked John Barnes.</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! Yes! Thanks&mdash;” she stammered in
confusion.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow night, then, at seven.
Thank you.” He hurried out embarrassed by
the grateful look that shone to him out of her
eyes. The gaze haunted him and hurt him. It
was the beseeching look of a homeless dog,
begging to be noticed. “Poor little immigrant,”
he thought, “how lonely she must be!”</p>

<p>“So he didn’t forget,” rejoiced Shenah Pessah.
“How only the sound from his voice opens
the sky in my heart! How the deadness and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
emptiness in me flames up into life! Ach! The
sun is again beginning to shine!”</p>

<p>An hour before the appointed time, Shenah
Pessah dressed herself in all her finery for John
Barnes. She swung open the door and stood in
readiness watching the little clock on the mantel-shelf.
The ticking thing seemed to throb
with the unutterable hopes compressed in her
heart, all the mute years of her stifled life. Each
little thud of time sang a wild song of released
joy&mdash;the joy of his coming nearer.</p>

<p>For the tenth time Shenah Pessah went over
in her mind what she would say to him when
he’d come.</p>

<p>“It was so kind from you to take from your
dear time&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;that sounds not good. I’ll begin like
this&mdash;Mr. Barnes! I can’t give it out in words
your kindness, to stop from your high thoughts
to&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! Oi weh! God from the world!
Why should it be so hard for me to say to him
what I mean? Why shouldn’t I be able to say
to him plain out&mdash;Mr. Barnes! You are an
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
angel from the sky! You are saving me my life
to let me only give a look on you! I’m happier
than a bird in the air when I think only that
such goodness like you&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sudden ring of the bell shattered all her
carefully rehearsed phrases and she met his
greeting in a flutter of confusion.</p>

<p>“My! Haven’t you blossomed out since last
night!” exclaimed Mr. Barnes, startled by
Shenah Pessah’s sudden display of color.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she flushed, raising to him her radiant
face. “I’m through for always with old women’s
shawls. This is my first American dress-up.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! So you want to be an American!
The next step will be to take up some work that
will bring you in touch with American people.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll help me? Yes?” Her eyes
sought his with an appeal of unquestioning
reliance.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought what kind of work
you would like to take up?” he asked, when
they got out into the street.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I want only to get away from the
basement. I’m crazy for people.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>“Would you like to learn a trade in a factory?”</p>

<p>“Anything&mdash;anything! I’m burning to learn.
Give me only an advice. What?”</p>

<p>“What can you do best with your hands?”</p>

<p>“With the hands the best? It’s all the same
what I do with the hands. Think you not maybe
now, I could begin already something with the
head? Yes?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon talk this over together, after you
have read a book that will tell you how to find
out what you are best fitted for.”</p>

<p>When they entered the library, Shenah Pessah
halted in awe. “What a stillness full from thinking!
So beautiful, it comes on me like music!”</p>

<p>“Yes. This is quite a place,” he acquiesced,
seeing again the public library in a new light
through her eyes. “Some of the best minds have
worked to give us just this.”</p>

<p>“How the book-ladies look so quiet like the
things.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, with a tell-tale glance at
her. “I too like to see a woman’s face above her
clothes.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>The approach of the librarian cut off further
comment. As Mr. Barnes filled out the application
card, Shenah Pessah noted the librarian’s
simple attire. “What means he a woman’s face
above her clothes?” she wondered. And the first
shadow of a doubt crossed her mind as to
whether her dearly bought apparel was pleasing
to his eyes. In the few brief words that
passed between Mr. Barnes and the librarian,
Shenah Pessah sensed that these two were of the
same world and that she was different. Her first
contact with him in a well-lighted room made
her aware that “there were other things to the
person besides the dress-up.” She had noticed
their well-kept hands on the desk and she became
aware that her own were calloused and
rough. That is why she felt her dirty finger-nails
curl in awkwardly to hide themselves as she
held the pen to sign her name.</p>

<p>When they were out in the street again, he
turned to her and said, “If you don’t mind, I’d
prefer to walk back. The night is so fine and
I’ve been in the stuffy office all day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind”&mdash;the words echoed within
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
her. If he only knew how above all else she
wanted this walk.</p>

<p>“It was grand in there, but the electric lights
are like so many eyes looking you over. In the
street it is easier for me. The dark covers you
up so good.”</p>

<p>He laughed, refreshed by her unconscious self-revelation.</p>

<p>“As long as you feel in your element let’s
walk on to the pier.”</p>

<p>“Like for a holiday, it feels itself in me,” she
bubbled, as he took her arm in crossing the
street. “Now see I America for the first time!”</p>

<p>It was all so wonderful to Barnes that in the
dirt and noise of the overcrowded ghetto, this
erstwhile drudge could be transfigured into such
a vibrant creature of joy. Even her clothes
that had seemed so bold and garish awhile ago,
were now inexplicably in keeping with the carnival
spirit that he felt steal over him.</p>

<p>As they neared the pier, he reflected strangely
upon the fact that out of the thousands of
needy, immigrant girls whom he might have
befriended, this eager young being at his side
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
was ordained by some peculiar providence to
come under his personal protection.</p>

<p>“How long did you say you have been in this
country, Shenah Pessah?”</p>

<p>“How long?” She echoed his words as though
waking from a dream. “It’s two years already.
But that didn’t count life. From now on I live.”</p>

<p>“And you mean to tell me that in all this time,
no one has taken you by the hand and shown
you the ways of our country? The pity of it!”</p>

<p>“I never had nothing, nor nobody. But now&mdash;it
dances under me the whole earth! It feels
in me grander than dreams!”</p>

<p>He drank in the pure joy out of her eyes. For
the moment, the girl beside him was the living
flame of incarnate Spring.</p>

<p>“He feels for me,” she rejoiced, as they
walked on in silence. The tenderness of his sympathy
enfolded her like some blessed warmth.</p>

<p>When they reached the end of the pier, they
paused and watched the moonlight playing on
the water. In the shelter of a truck they felt
benignly screened from any stray glances of the
loiterers near by.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>How big seemed his strength as he stood silhouetted
against the blue night! For the first
time Shenah Pessah noticed the splendid
straightness of his shoulders. The clean glowing
youth of him drew her like a spell.</p>

<p>“Ach! Only to keep always inside my heart
the kindness, the gentlemanness that shines
from his face,” thought Shenah Pessah, instinctively
nestling closer.</p>

<p>“Poor little immigrant!” murmured John
Barnes. “How lonely, how barren your life must
have been till&mdash;” In an impulse of compassion,
his arms opened and Shenah Pessah felt her
soul swoon in ecstasy as he drew her toward him.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It was three days since the eventful evening on
the pier and Shenah Pessah had not seen John
Barnes since. He had vanished like a dream,
and yet he was not a dream. He was the only
thing real in the unreal emptiness of her unlived
life. She closed her eyes and she saw again
his face with its joy-giving smile. She heard
again his voice and felt again his arms around
her as he kissed her lips. Then in the midst of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
her sweetest visioning a gnawing emptiness
seized her and the cruel ache of withheld love
sucked dry all those beautiful feelings his presence
inspired. Sometimes there flashed across
her fevered senses the memory of his compassionate
endearments: “Poor lonely little immigrant!”
And she felt his sweet words smite
her flesh with their cruel mockery.</p>

<p>She went about her work with restlessness.
At each step, at each sound, she started, “Maybe
it’s him! Maybe!” She could not fall asleep
at night, but sat up in bed writing and tearing
up letters to him. The only lull to the storm
that uprooted her being was in trying to tell him
how every throb within her clamored for him, but
the most heart-piercing cry that she could utter
only stabbed her heart with the futility of words.</p>

<p>In the course of the week it was Shenah Pessah’s
duty to clean Mrs. Stein’s floor. This
brought her to Mr. Barnes’s den in his absence.
She gazed about her, calling up his presence
at the sight of his belongings.</p>

<p>“How fine to the touch is the feel from everything
his,” she sighed, tenderly resting her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
cheek on his dressing-gown. With a timid hand
she picked up a slipper that stood beside his bed
and she pressed it to her heart reverently. “I
wish I was this leather thing only to hold his
feet!” Then she turned to his dresser and passed
her hands caressingly over the ivory things on
it. “Ach! You lucky brush&mdash;smoothing his
hair every day!”</p>

<p>All at once she heard footsteps, and before
she could collect her thoughts, he entered. Her
whole being lit up with the joy of his coming.
But one glance at him revealed to her the
changed expression that darkened his face.
His arms hung limply at his side&mdash;the arms
she expected to stretch out to her and enfold
her. As if struck in the face by his heartless
rebuff, she rushed out blindly.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, please,” he managed to detain
her. “As a gentleman, I owe you an apology.
That night&mdash;it was a passing moment of
forgetfulness. It’s not to happen again&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before he had finished, she had run out
scorched with shame by his words.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he ejaculated, when he found
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
he was alone. “Who’d ever think that she
would take it so? I suppose there is no use trying
to explain to her.”</p>

<p>For some time he sat on his bed, staring ruefully.
Then, springing to his feet, he threw his
things together in a valise. “You’d be a cad if
you did not clear out of here at once,” he muttered
to himself. “No matter how valuable the
scientific inquiry might prove to be, you can’t
let the girl run away with herself.”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah was at the window when she
saw John Barnes go out with his suitcases.</p>

<p>“In God’s name, don’t leave me!” she longed
to cry out. “You are the only bit of light that I
ever had, and now it will be darker and emptier
for my eyes than ever before!” But no voice
could rise out of her parched lips. She felt a
faintness stunning her senses as though some
one had cut open the arteries of her wrists and
all the blood rushed out of her body.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” she moaned. “Then it was all
nothing to him. Why did he make bitter to me
the little sweetness that was dearer to me than
my life? What means he a gentleman?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>“Why did he make me to shame telling me
he didn’t mean nothing? Is it because I’m not a
lady alike to him? Is a gentleman only a make-believe
man?”</p>

<p>With a defiant resolve she seized hold of herself
and rose to her feet. “Show him what’s in
you. If it takes a year, or a million years, you
got to show him you’re a person. From now on,
you got why to live. You got to work not with
the strength of one body and one brain, but with
the strength of a million bodies and a million
brains. By day and by night, you got to push,
push yourself up till you get to him and can
look him in his face eye to eye.”</p>

<p>Spent by the fervor of this new exaltation, she
sat with her head in her hands in a dull stupor.
Little by little the darkness cleared from her
soul and a wistful serenity crept over her. She
raised her face toward the solitary ray of sunlight
that stole into her basement room.</p>

<p>“After all, he done for you more than you
could do for him. You owe it to him the deepest,
the highest he waked up in you. He opened the
wings of your soul.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>HUNGER</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Shenah Pessah</span> paused in the midst of scrubbing
the stairs of the tenement. “Ach!” she
sighed. “How can his face still burn so in
me when he is so long gone? How the deadness
in me flames up with life at the thought of
him!”</p>

<p>The dark hallway seemed flooded with white
radiance. She closed her eyes that she might
see more vividly the beloved features. The
glowing smile that healed all ills of life and
changed her from the weary drudge into the
vibrant creature of joy.</p>

<p>It was all a miracle&mdash;his coming, this young
professor from one of the big colleges. He had
rented a room in the very house where she was
janitress so as to be near the people he was
writing about. But more wonderful than all was
the way he stopped to talk to her, to question
her about herself as though she were his equal.
What warm friendliness had prompted him to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
take her out of her dark basement to the library
where there were books to read!</p>

<p>And then&mdash;that unforgettable night on the
way home, when the air was poignant with
spring! Only a moment&mdash;a kiss&mdash;a pressure
of hands! And the world shone with light&mdash;the
empty, unlived years filled with love!</p>

<p>She was lost in dreams of her one hour of romance
when a woman elbowed her way through
the dim passage, leaving behind her the smell
of herring and onions.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah gripped the scrubbing-brush
with suppressed fury. “Meshugeneh! Did you
not swear to yourself that you would tear his
memory out from your heart? If he would have
been only a man I could have forgotten him.
But he was not a man! He was God Himself!
On whatever I look shines his face!”</p>

<p>The white radiance again suffused her. The
brush dropped from her hand. “He&mdash;he is the
beating in my heart! He is the life in me&mdash;the
hope in me&mdash;the breath of prayer in me! If
not for him in me, then what am I? Deadness&mdash;emptiness&mdash;nothingness!
You are going out
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
of your head. You are living only on rainbows.
He is no more real&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is real? These rags I wear? This pail?
This black hole? Or him and the dreams of him?”
She flung her challenge to the murky darkness.</p>

<p>“Shenah Pessah! A black year on you!” came
the answer from the cellar below. It was the
voice of her uncle, Moisheh Rifkin.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” she shrugged young shoulders,
wearied by joyless toil. “He’s beginning with
his hollering already.” And she hurried down.</p>

<p>“You piece of earth! Worms should eat you!
How long does it take you to wash up the
stairs?” he stormed. “Yesterday, the eating was
burned to coal; and to-day you forget the salt.”</p>

<p>“What a fuss over a little less salt!”</p>

<p>“In the Talmud it stands a man has a right
to divorce his wife for only forgetting him the
salt in his soup.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s why Aunt Gittel went to the
grave before her time&mdash;worrying how to please
your taste in the mouth.”</p>

<p>The old man’s yellow, shriveled face stared
up at her out of the gloom. “What has he from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
life? Only his pleasure in eating and going to the
synagogue. How long will he live yet?” And
moved by a surge of pity, “Why can’t I be a
little kind to him?”</p>

<p>“Did you chop me some herring and onions?”
he interrupted harshly.</p>

<p>She flushed with conscious guilt. Again she
wondered why ugly things and ugly smells so
sickened her.</p>

<p>“What don’t you forget?” His voice hammered
upon her ears. “No care lays in your
head. You’re only dreaming in the air.”</p>

<p>Her compassion was swept away in a wave of
revolt that left her trembling. “I can’t no more
stand it from you! Get yourself somebody else!”
She was surprised at her sudden spirit.</p>

<p>“You big mouth, you! That’s your thanks
for saving you from hunger.”</p>

<p>“Two years already I’m working the nails off
my fingers and you didn’t give me a cent.”</p>

<p>“Beggerin! Money yet, you want? The minute
you get enough to eat you turn up your head
with freshness. Are you used to anything from
home? What were you out there in Savel? The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
dirt under people’s feet. You’re already forgetting
how you came off from the ship&mdash;a
bundle of rags full of holes. If you lived in Russia
a hundred years would you have lived to
wear a pair of new shoes on your feet?”</p>

<p>“Other girls come naked and with nothing
to America and they work themselves up.
Everybody gets wages in America&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Americanerin! Didn’t I spend out enough
money on your ship-ticket to have a little use
from you? A thunder should strike you!”</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah’s eyes flamed. Her broken finger-nails
pierced the callous flesh of her hands.
So this was the end&mdash;the awakening of her
dreams of America! Her memory went back to
the time her ship-ticket came. In her simple
faith she had really believed that they wanted
her&mdash;her father’s brother and his wife who had
come to the new world before ever she was born.
She thought they wanted to give her a chance
for happiness, for life and love. And then she
came&mdash;to find the paralytic aunt&mdash;housework&mdash;janitor’s
drudgery. Even after her aunt’s
death, she had gone on uncomplainingly, till her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
uncle’s nagging had worn down her last shred of
self-control.</p>

<p>“It’s the last time you’ll holler on me!” she
cried. “You’ll never see my face again if I got to
go begging in the street.” Seizing her shawl, she
rushed out. “Woe is me! Bitter is me! For what
is my life? Why didn’t the ship go under and
drown me before I came to America?”</p>

<p>Through the streets, like a maddened thing,
she raced, not knowing where she was going,
not caring. “For what should I keep on suffering?
Who needs me? Who wants me? I got nobody&mdash;nobody!”</p>

<p>And then the vision of the face she worshiped
flashed before her. His beautiful kindness that
had once warmed her into new life breathed
over her again. “Why did he ever come but to
lift me out of my darkness into his light?”</p>

<p>Instinctively her eyes sought the rift of blue
above the tenement roofs and were caught by
a boldly printed placard: “<span class="small-caps">Hands Wanted.</span>”
It was as though the sign swung open on its
hinges like a door and arms stretched out inviting
her to enter. From the sign she looked to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
her own hands&mdash;vigorous, young hands&mdash;made
strong through toil.</p>

<p>Hope leaped within her. “Maybe I got yet
luck to have it good in this world. Ach! God
from the sky! I’m so burning to live&mdash;to work
myself up for a somebody! And why not?”
With clenched fist she smote her bosom. “Ain’t
everything possible in the new world? Why is
America but to give me the chance to lift up
my head with everybody alike?”</p>

<p>Her feet scarcely touched the steps as she ran
up. But when she reached the huge, iron door of
Cohen Brothers, a terror seized her. “Oi weh!
They’ll give a look on my greenhorn rags, and
down I go&mdash;For what are you afraid, you fool?”
she commanded herself. “You come not to beg.
They need hands. Don’t the sign say so? And
you got good, strong hands that can turn over
the earth with their strength. America is before
you. You’ll begin to earn money. You’ll dress
yourself up like a person and men will fall on
their knees to make love to you&mdash;even him&mdash;himself!”</p>

<p>All fear had left her. She flung open the door
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
and beheld the wonder of a factory&mdash;people&mdash;people&mdash;seas
of bent heads and busy hands
of people&mdash;the whirr of machinery&mdash;flying
belts&mdash;the clicking clatter of whirling wheels&mdash;all
seemed to blend and fuse into one surging
song of hope&mdash;of new life&mdash;a new world&mdash;America!</p>

<p>A man, his arms heaped with a bundle of
shirts, paused at sight of the radiant face. Her
ruddy cheeks, the film of innocence shining out
of eyes that knew no guile, carried him back to
the green fields and open plains of his native
Russia.</p>

<p>“Her mother’s milk is still fresh on her lips,”
he murmured, as his gaze enveloped her.</p>

<p>The bundle slipped and fell to her feet. Their
eyes met in spontaneous recognition of common
race. With an embarrassed laugh they stooped
to gather up the shirts.</p>

<p>“I seen downstairs hands wanted,” came in a
faltering voice.</p>

<p>“Then you’re looking for work?” he questioned
with keen interest. She was so different
from the others he had known in his five years
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
in this country. He was seized with curiosity to
know more.</p>

<p>“You ain’t been long in America?” His tone
was an unconscious caress.</p>

<p>“Two years already,” she confessed. “But I
ain’t so green like I look,” she added quickly,
overcome by the old anxiety.</p>

<p>“Trust yourself on me,” Sam Arkin assured
her. “I’m a feller that knows himself on a person
first off. I’ll take you to the office myself.
Wait only till I put away these things.”</p>

<p>Grinning with eagerness, he returned and together
they sought the foreman.</p>

<p>“Good luck to you! I hope you’ll be pushed
up soon to my floor,” Sam Arkin encouraged, as
he hurried back to his machine.</p>

<p>Because of the rush of work and the scarcity
of help, Shenah Pessah was hired without delay.
Atremble with excitement, she tiptoed after the
foreman as he led the way into the workroom.</p>

<p>“Here, Sadie Kranz, is another learner for
you.” He addressed a big-bosomed girl, the most
skillful worker in the place.</p>

<p>“Another greenhorn with a wooden head!”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
she whispered to her neighbor as Shenah Pessah
removed her shawl. “Gevalt! All these greenhorn
hands tear the bread from our mouths by
begging to work so cheap.”</p>

<p>But the dumb appeal of the immigrant
stirred vague memories in Sadie Kranz. As she
watched her run her first seam, she marveled at
her speed. “I got to give it to you, you have a
quick head.” There was conscious condescension
in her praise.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah lifted a beaming face. “How
kind it was from you to learn me! You good
heart!”</p>

<p>No one had ever before called Sadie Kranz
“good heart.” The words lingered pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Ut! I like to help anybody, so long it don’t
cost me nothing. I get paid by the week anyhow,”
she half apologized.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah was so thrilled with the novelty
of the work, the excitement of mastering
the intricacies of her machine, that she did
not realize that the day was passed until the bell
rang, the machines came to a halt, and the
“hands” made a wild rush for the cloak-room.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>“Oi weh! Is it a fire?” Shenah Pessah
blanched with dread.</p>

<p>Loud laughter quelled her fears. “Greenie!
It’s six o’clock. Time to go home,” chorused the
voices.</p>

<p>“Home?” The cry broke from her. “Where
will I go? I got no home.” She stood bewildered,
in the fast-dwindling crowd of workers.
Each jostling by her had a place to go. Of
them all, she alone was friendless, shelterless!</p>

<p>“Help me find a place to sleep!” she implored,
seizing Sadie Kranz by the sleeve of her velvet
coat. “I got no people. I ran away.”</p>

<p>Sadie Kranz narrowed her eyes at the girl. A
feeling of pity crept over her at sight of the outstretched,
hungry hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you by me for the while.” And taking
the shawl off the shelf, she tossed it to the
forlorn bundle of rags. “Come along. You must
be starved for some eating.”</p>

<p>As Shenah Pessah entered the dingy hall-room
which Sadie Kranz called home, its chill
and squalor carried her back to the janitor’s
basement she had left that morning. In silence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
she watched her companion prepare the
hot dogs and potatoes on the oil-stove atop
the trunk. Such pressing sadness weighed upon
her that she turned from even the smell of
food.</p>

<p>“My heart pulls me so to go back to my
uncle.” She swallowed hard her crust of black
bread. “He’s so used to have me help him.
What’ll he do&mdash;alone?”</p>

<p>“You got to look out for yourself in this
world.” Sadie Kranz gesticulated with a hot
potato. “With your quickness, you got a chance
to make money and buy clothes. You can go
to shows&mdash;dances. And who knows&mdash;maybe
meet a man to get married.”</p>

<p>“Married? You know how it burns in every
girl to get herself married&mdash;that’s how it burns
in me to work myself up for a person.”</p>

<p>“Ut! For what need you to work yourself up.
Better marry yourself up to a rich feller and
you’re fixed for life.”</p>

<p>“But him I want&mdash;he ain’t just a man. He
is&mdash;” She paused seeking for words and a
mist of longing softened the heavy peasant
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
features. “He is the golden hills on the sky. I’m
as far from him as the earth is from the stars.”</p>

<p>“Yok! Why wills itself in you the stars?” her
companion ridiculed between swallows.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah flung out her hands with Jewish
fervor. “Can I help it what’s in my heart?
It always longs in me for the higher. Maybe he
has long ago forgotten me, but only one hope
drives in me like madness&mdash;to make myself
alike to him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the truth,” laughed Sadie Kranz,
fishing in the pot for the last frankfurter. “You
are a little out of your head&mdash;plain mehsugeh.”</p>

<p>“Mehsugeh?” Shenah Pessah rose to her feet
vibrant with new resolve. “Mehsugeh?” she
challenged, her peasant youth afire with ambition.
“I’ll yet show the world what’s in me.
I’ll not go back to my uncle&mdash;till it rings with
my name in America.”</p>

<p>She entered the factory, the next day, with a
light in her face, a sureness in her step that made
all pause in wonder. “Look only! How high she
holds herself her head! Has the matchmaker
promised her a man?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>Then came her first real triumph. Shenah
Pessah was raised above old hands who had
been in the shop for years and made assistant to
Sam Arkin, the man who had welcomed her
that first day in the factory. As she was shown
to the bench beside him, she waited expectantly
for a word of welcome. None came. Instead, he
bent the closer to his machine and the hand
that held the shirt trembled as though he were
cold, though the hot color flooded his face.</p>

<p>Resolutely, she turned to her work. She would
show him how skillful she had become in those
few weeks. The seams sped under her lightning
touch when a sudden clatter startled her. She
jumped up terror-stricken.</p>

<p>“The belt! The belt slipped! But it’s nothing,
little bird,” Sam Arkin hastened to assure
her. “I’ll fix it.” And then the quick warning,
“Sh-h! The foreman is coming!”</p>

<p>Accustomed to her uncle’s harsh bickering,
this man’s gentleness overwhelmed her. There
was something she longed to say that trembled
on her lips, but her voice refused to come.</p>

<p>Sam Arkin, too, was inarticulate. He felt
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
he must talk to her, must know more of her.
Timidly he touched her sleeve. “Lunch-time&mdash;here&mdash;wait
for me,” he whispered, as the foreman
approached.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>A shrill whistle&mdash;the switch thrown&mdash;the
slowing-down of the machines, then the deafening
hush proclaiming noon. Followed the scraping
of chairs, raucous voices, laughter, and the
rush on the line to reach the steaming cauldron.
One by one, as their cups of tea were filled, the
hungry workers dispersed into groups. Seated
on window-sills, table-tops, machines, and bales
of shirts, they munched black bread and herring
and sipped tea from saucers. And over all
rioted the acrid odor of garlic and onions.</p>

<p>Rebecca Feist, the belle of the shop, pulled
up the sleeve of her Georgette waist and glanced
down at her fifty-nine-cent silk stocking. “A lot
it pays for a girl to kill herself to dress stylish.
Give only a look on Sam Arkin, how stuck he is
on that new hand.”</p>

<p>There followed a chorus of voices. “Such
freshness! We been in the shop so long and she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
just gives a come-in and grabs the cream as if
it’s coming to her.”</p>

<p>“It’s her innocent-looking baby eyes that
fools him in&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Innocent! Pfui! These make-believe innocent
girls! Leave it to them! They know how
to shine themselves up to a feller!”</p>

<p>Bleemah Levine, a stoop-shouldered, old
hand, grown gray with the grayness of unrelieved
drudgery, cast a furtive look in the direction
of the couple. “Ach! The little bit of
luck! Not looks, not smartness, but only luck,
and the world falls to your feet.” Her lips tightened
with envy. “It’s her greenhorn, red
cheeks&mdash;”</p>

<p>Rebecca Feist glanced at herself in the mirror
of her vanity bag. It was a pretty, young face,
but pale and thin from undernourishment.
Adroitly applying a lip-stick, she cried indignantly:
“I wish I could be such a false thing
like her. But only, I’m too natural&mdash;the hypocrite!”</p>

<p>Sadie Kranz rose to her friend’s defense.
“What are you falling on her like a pack of wild
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
dogs, just because Sam Arkin gives a smile on
her? He ain’t marrying her yet, is he?”</p>

<p>“We don’t say nothing against her,” retorted
Rebecca Feist, tapping her diamond-buckled
foot, “only, she pushes herself too
much. Give her a finger and she’ll grab your
whole hand. Is there a limit to the pushings of
such a green animal? Only a while ago, she was
a learner, a nobody, and soon she’ll jump over
all our heads and make herself for a forelady.”</p>

<p>Sam Arkin, seated beside Shenah Pessah on
the window-sill, had forgotten that it was lunch-hour
and that he was savagely hungry. “It
shines so from your eyes,” he beamed. “What
happy thoughts lay in your head?”</p>

<p>“Ach! When I give myself a look around on
all the people laughing and talking, it makes me
so happy I’m one of them.”</p>

<p>“Ut! These Americanerins! Their heads is
only on ice-cream soda and style.”</p>

<p>“But it makes me feel so grand to be with all
these hands alike. It’s as if I just got out from
the choking prison into the open air of my own
people.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>She paused for breath&mdash;a host of memories
overpowering her. “I can’t give it out in words,”
she went on. “But just as there ain’t no bottom
to being poor, there ain’t no bottom to being
lonely. Before, everything I done was alone,
by myself. My heart hurt so with hunger for
people. But here, in the factory, I feel I’m with
everybody together. Just the sight of people
lifts me on wings in the air.”</p>

<p>Opening her bag of lunch which had lain unheeded
in her lap, she turned to him with a
queer, little laugh, “I don’t know why I’m so
talking myself out to you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only talk more. I want to know everything
about yourself.” An aching tenderness rushed
out of his heart to her, and in his grave simplicity
he told her how he had overheard one of
the girls say that she, Shenah Pessah, looked
like a “greeneh yenteh,” just landed from the
ship, so that he cried out, “Gottuniu! If only
the doves from the sky were as beautiful!”</p>

<p>They looked at each other solemnly&mdash;the
girl’s lips parted, her eyes wide and serious.</p>

<p>“That first day I came to the shop, the minute
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
I gave a look on you, I felt right away, here’s
somebody from home. I used to tremble so to
talk to a man, but you&mdash;you&mdash;I could talk
myself out to you like thinking in myself.”</p>

<p>“You’re all soft silk and fine velvet,” he
breathed reverently. “In this hard world, how
could such fineness be?”</p>

<p>An embarrassed silence fell between them as
she knotted and unknotted her colored kerchief.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you home? Yes?” he found voice
at last.</p>

<p>Under lowered lashes she smiled her consent.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for you downstairs, closing time.”
And he was gone.</p>

<p>The noon hour was not yet over, but Shenah
Pessah returned to her machine. “Shall I tell
him?” she mused. “Sam Arkin understands so
much, shall I tell him of this man that burns in
me? If I could only give out to some one about
him in my heart&mdash;it would make me a little
clear in the head.” She glanced at Sam Arkin
furtively. “He’s kind, but could he understand?
I only made a fool from myself trying to tell
Sadie Kranz.” All at once she began to sob without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
reason. She ran to the cloak-room and hid
from prying eyes, behind the shawls and wraps.
The emptiness of all for which she struggled
pressed upon her like a dead weight, dragging
her down, down&mdash;the reaction of her ecstasy.</p>

<p>As the gong sounded, she made a desperate
effort to pull herself together and returned to her
work.</p>

<p>The six o’clock whistles still reverberated
when Sam Arkin hurried down the factory
stairs and out to the corner where he was to
meet Shenah Pessah. He cleared his throat to
greet her as she came, but all he managed was a
bashful grin. She was so near, so real, and he had
so much to say&mdash;if he only knew how to begin.</p>

<p>He cracked his knuckles and bit his finger-tips,
but no words came. “Ach! You yok! Why
ain’t you saying something?” He wrestled with
his shyness in vain. The tense silence remained
unbroken till they reached her house.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry”&mdash;Shenah Pessah colored apologetically&mdash;“But
I got no place to invite you.
My room is hardly big enough for a push-in of
one person.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>“What say you to a bite of eating with me?”
he blurted.</p>

<p>She thought of her scant supper upstairs and
would have responded eagerly, but glancing
down at her clothes, she hesitated. “Could I go
dressed like this in a restaurant?”</p>

<p>“You look grander plain, like you are, than
those twisted up with style. I’ll take you to the
swellest restaurant on Grand Street and be
proud with you!”</p>

<p>She flushed with pleasure. “Nu, come on,
then. It’s good to have a friend that knows himself
on what’s in you and not what’s on you, but
still, when I go to a place, I like to be dressed
like a person so I can feel like a person.”</p>

<p>“You’ll yet live to wear diamonds that will
shine up the street when you pass!” he cried.</p>

<p>Through streets growing black with swarming
crowds of toil-released workers they made
their way. Sam Arkin’s thick hand rested with
a lightness new to him upon the little arm
tucked under his. The haggling pushcart peddlers,
the newsboys screaming, “Tageblatt,
Abendblatt, Herold,” the roaring noises of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
elevated trains resounded the pæan of joy
swelling his heart.</p>

<p>“America was good to me, but I never guessed
how good till now.” The words were out before
he knew it. “Tell me only, what pulled you to
this country?”</p>

<p>“What pulls anybody here? The hope for the
better. People who got it good in the old world
don’t hunger for the new.”</p>

<p>A mist filled her eyes at memory of her native
village. “How I suffered in Savel. I never
had enough to eat. I never had shoes on my
feet. I had to go barefoot even in the freezing
winter. But still I love it. I was born there. I
love the houses and the straw roofs, the mud
streets, the cows, the chickens and the goats.
My heart always hurts me for what is no more.”</p>

<p>The brilliant lights of Levy’s Café brought
her back to Grand Street.</p>

<p>“Here is it.” He led her in and over to a corner
table. “Chopped herring and onions for
two,” he ordered with a flourish.</p>

<p>“Ain’t there some American eating on the
card?” interposed Shenah Pessah.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>He laughed indulgently. “If I lived in America
for a hundred years I couldn’t get used to the
American eating. What can make the mouth so
water like the taste and the smell from herring
and onions?”</p>

<p>“There’s something in me&mdash;I can’t help&mdash;that
so quickly takes on to the American taste.
It’s as if my outside skin only was Russian; the
heart in me is for everything of the new world&mdash;even
the eating.”</p>

<p>“Nu, I got nothing to complain against
America. I don’t like the American eating, but
I like the American dollar. Look only on me!”
He expanded his chest. “I came to America a
ragged nothing&mdash;and&mdash;see&mdash;” He exhibited
a bank-book in four figures, gesticulating
grandly, “And I learned in America how to
sign my name!”</p>

<p>“Did it come hard to learn?” she asked under
her breath.</p>

<p>“Hard?” His face purpled with excitement.
“It would be easier for me to lift up this whole
house on my shoulders than to make one little
dot of a letter. When I took my pencil&mdash;Oi
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
weh! The sweat would break out on my face!
‘I can’t, I can’t!’ I cried, but something in me
jumped up. ‘You can&mdash;you yok&mdash;you must!’&mdash;Six
months, night after night, I stuck to it&mdash;and
I learned to twist around the little black
hooks till it means&mdash;me&mdash;Sam Arkin.”</p>

<p>He had the rough-hewn features of the common
people, but he lifted his head with the
pride of a king. “Since I can write out my name,
I feel I can do anything. I can sign checks, put
money in the bank, or take it out without nobody
to help me.”</p>

<p>As Shenah Pessah listened, unconsciously
she compared Sam Arkin, glowing with the
frank conceit of the self-made man, his neglected
teeth, thick, red lips, with that of the
Other One&mdash;made ever more beautiful with
longings and dreams.</p>

<p>“But in all these black years, I was always
hoping to get to the golden country,” Sam
Arkin’s voice went on, but she heard it as from
afar. “Before my eyes was always the shine of
the high wages and the easy money and I kept
pushing myself from one city to another, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>
saving and saving till I saved up enough for my
ship-ticket to the new world. And then when I
landed here, I fell into the hands of a cockroach
boss.”</p>

<p>“A cockroach boss?” she questioned absently
and reproached herself for her inattention.</p>

<p>“A black year on him! He was a landsman,
that’s how he fooled me in. He used to come to
the ship with a smiling face of welcome to all
the greenhorns what had nobody to go to. And
then he’d put them to work in his sweatshop
and sweat them into their grave.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it?” she cried with quickened
understanding. “Just like my uncle, Moisheh
Rifkin.”</p>

<p>“The blood-sucker!” he gasped. “When I
think how I slaved for him sixteen hours a day&mdash;for
what? Nothing!”</p>

<p>She gently stroked his hand as one might a
child in pain. He looked up and smiled gratefully.</p>

<p>“I want to forget what’s already over. I
got enough money now to start for myself&mdash;maybe
a tailor-shop&mdash;and soon&mdash;I&mdash;I want
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
to marry myself&mdash;but none of those crazy
chickens for me.” And he seemed to draw her
unto himself by the intensity of his gaze.</p>

<p>Growing bolder, he exclaimed: “I got a
grand idea. It’s Monday and the bank is open
yet till nine o’clock. I’ll write over my bank-book
on your name? Yes?”</p>

<p>“My name?” She fell back, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you&mdash;everything I only got&mdash;you&mdash;”
he mumbled. “I’ll give you dove’s
milk to drink&mdash;silks and diamonds to wear&mdash;you’ll
hold all my money.”</p>

<p>She was shaken by this supreme proof of his
devotion.</p>

<p>“But I&mdash;I can’t&mdash;I got to work myself up
for a person. I got a head. I got ideas. I can
catch on to the Americans quicker’n lightning.”</p>

<p>“My money can buy you everything. I’ll
buy you teachers. I’ll buy you a piano. I’ll
make you for a lady. Right away you can stop
from work.” He leaned toward her, his eyes
welling with tears of earnestness.</p>

<p>“Take your hard-earned money? Could I be
such a beggerin?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>“God from the world! You are dearer to me
than the eyes from my head! I’d give the blood
from under my nails for you! I want only to
work for you&mdash;to live for you&mdash;to die for
you&mdash;” He was spent with the surge of his
emotion.</p>

<p>Ach! To be loved as Sam Arkin loved! She
covered her eyes, but it only pressed upon her
the more. Home, husband, babies, a bread-giver
for life!</p>

<p>And the Other&mdash;a dream&mdash;a madness that
burns you up alive. “You might as well want to
marry yourself to the President of America as
to want him. But I can’t help it. <em>Him and him
only</em> I want.”</p>

<p>She looked up again. “No&mdash;no!” she cried,
cruel in the self-absorption of youth and ambition.
“You can’t make me for a person. It’s not
only that I got to go up higher, but I got to push
myself up by myself, by my own strength&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nu, nu,” he sobbed. “I’ll not bother you
with me&mdash;only give you my everything. My
bank-book is more than my flesh and blood&mdash;only
take it, to do what you want with it.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>Her eyes deepened with humility. “I know
your goodness&mdash;but there’s something like a
wall around me&mdash;him in my heart.”</p>

<p>“Him?” The word hurled itself at him like a
bomb-shell. He went white with pain. And even
she, immersed in her own thoughts, lowered her
head before the dumb suffering on his face. She
felt she owed it to him to tell him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk myself out to you about
him yet before.&mdash;He ain’t just a man. He is all
that I want to be and am not yet. He is the
hunger of me for the life that ain’t just eating
and sleeping and slaving for bread.”</p>

<p>She pushed back her chair and rose abruptly.
“I can’t be inside walls when I talk of him. I
need the earth, the whole free sky to breathe
when I think of him. Come out in the air.”</p>

<p>They walked for a time before either spoke.
Sam Arkin followed where she led through the
crooked labyrinth of streets. The sight of the
young mothers with their nursing infants pressed
to their bared bosoms stabbed anew his hurt.</p>

<p>Shenah Pessah, blind to all but the vision
that obsessed her, talked on. “All that my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
mother and father and my mother’s mother
and father ever wanted to be is in him. This fire
in me, it’s not just the hunger of a woman for
a man&mdash;it’s the hunger of all my people back of
me, from all ages, for light, for the life higher!”</p>

<p>A veil of silence fell between them. She felt
almost as if it were a sacrilege to have spoken of
that which was so deeply centered within her.</p>

<p>Sam Arkin’s face became lifeless as clay.
Bowed like an old man, he dragged his leaden
feet after him. The world was dead&mdash;cold&mdash;meaningless.
Bank-book, money&mdash;of what use
were they now? All his years of saving couldn’t
win her. He was suffocated in emptiness.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>On they walked till they reached a deserted
spot in the park. So spent was he by his sorrow
that he lost the sense of time or place or that
she was near.</p>

<p>Leaning against a tree, he stood, dumb,
motionless, unutterable bewilderment in his
sunken eyes.</p>

<p>“I lived over the hunger for bread&mdash;but
this&mdash;” He clutched at his aching bosom.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
“Highest One, help me!” With his face to the
ground he sank, prostrate.</p>

<p>“Sam Arkin!” She bent over him tenderly.
“I feel the emptiness of words&mdash;but I got to
get it out. All that you suffer I have suffered,
and must yet go on suffering. I see no end.
But only&mdash;there is a something&mdash;a hope&mdash;a
help out&mdash;it lifts me on top of my hungry
body&mdash;the hunger to make from myself a person
that can’t be crushed by nothing nor nobody&mdash;the
life higher!”</p>

<p>Slowly, he rose to his feet, drawn from his
weakness by the spell of her. “With one hand
you throw me down and with the other you lift
me up to life again. Say to me only again, your
words,” he pleaded, helplessly.</p>

<p>“Sam Arkin! Give yourself your own
strength!” She shook him roughly. “I got no
pity on you, no more than I got pity on me.”</p>

<p>He saw her eyes fill with light as though she
were seeing something far beyond them both.
“This,” she breathed, “is only the beginning of
the hunger that will make from you a person
who’ll yet ring in America.”</p>

  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>THE LOST “BEAUTIFULNESS”</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">Oi weh!</span> How it shines the beautifulness!”
exulted Hanneh Hayyeh over her newly
painted kitchen. She cast a glance full of worship
and adoration at the picture of her son in
uniform; eyes like her own, shining with eagerness,
with joy of life, looked back at her.</p>

<p>“Aby will not have to shame himself to come
back to his old home,” she rejoiced, clapping
her hands&mdash;hands blistered from the paintbrush
and calloused from rough toil. “Now
he’ll be able to invite all the grandest friends he
made in the army.”</p>

<p>The smell of the paint was suffocating, but
she inhaled in it huge draughts of hidden
beauty. For weeks she had dreamed of it and
felt in each tin of paint she was able to buy, in
each stroke of the brush, the ecstasy of loving
service for the son she idolized.</p>

<p>Ever since she first began to wash the fine
silks and linens for Mrs. Preston, years ago, it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
had been Hanneh Hayyeh’s ambition to have a
white-painted kitchen exactly like that in the
old Stuyvesant Square mansion. Now her own
kitchen was a dream come true.</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh ran in to her husband, a
stoop-shouldered, care-crushed man who was
leaning against the bed, his swollen feet outstretched,
counting the pennies that totaled his
day’s earnings.</p>

<p>“Jake Safransky!” she cried excitedly, “you
got to come in and give a look on my painting
before you go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oi, let me alone. Give me only a rest.”</p>

<p>Too intoxicated with the joy of achievement
to take no for an answer, she dragged him into
the doorway. “Nu? How do you like it? Do I
know what beautiful is?”</p>

<p>“But how much money did you spend out on
that paint?”</p>

<p>“It was my own money,” she said, wiping the
perspiration off her face with a corner of her
apron. “Every penny I earned myself from the
extra washing.”</p>

<p>“But you had ought save it up for the bad
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
times. What’ll you do when the cold weather
starts in and the pushcart will not wheel itself
out?”</p>

<p>“I save and pinch enough for myself. This
I done in honor for my son. I want my Aby to
lift up his head in the world. I want him to be
able to invite even the President from America
to his home and shame himself.”</p>

<p>“You’d pull the bananas off a blind man’s
pushcart to bring to your Aby. You know
nothing from holding tight to a dollar and saving
a penny to a penny like poor people should.”</p>

<p>“What do I got from living if I can’t have a
little beautifulness in my life? I don’t allow for
myself the ten cents to go to a moving picture
that I’m crazy to see. I never yet treated myself
to an ice-cream soda even for a holiday. Shining
up the house for Aby is my only pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Yah, but it ain’t your house. It’s the landlord’s.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I live in it? I soak in pleasure from
every inch of my kitchen. Why, I could kiss the
grand white color on the walls. It lights up my
eyes like sunshine in the room.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>Her glance traveled from the newly painted
walls to the geranium on the window-sill, and
back to her husband’s face.</p>

<p>“Jake!” she cried, shaking him, “ain’t you
got eyes? How can you look on the way it
dances the beautifulness from every corner and
not jump in the air from happiness?”</p>

<p>“I’m only thinking on the money you spent
out on the landlord’s house. Look only on me!
I’m black from worry, but no care lays on your
head. It only dreams itself in you how to make
yourself for an American and lay in every
penny you got on fixing out the house like
the rich.”</p>

<p>“I’m sick of living like a pig with my nose to
the earth, all the time only pinching and scraping
for bread and rent. So long my Aby is with
America, I want to make myself for an American.
I could tear the stars out from heaven for
my Aby’s wish.”</p>

<p>Her sunken cheeks were flushed and her eyes
glowed with light as she gazed about her.</p>

<p>“When I see myself around the house how I
fixed it up with my own hands, I forget I’m
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
only a nobody. It makes me feel I’m also a person
like Mrs. Preston. It lifts me with high
thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you marry yourself to a millionaire?
You always want to make yourself like
Mrs. Preston who got millions laying in the
bank.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Preston does make me feel that
I’m alike with her,” returned Hanneh Hayyeh,
proudly. “Don’t she talk herself out to me like
I was her friend? Mrs. Preston says this war is
to give everybody a chance to lift up his head
like a person. It is to bring together the people
on top who got everything and the people on
the bottom who got nothing. She’s been telling
me about a new word&mdash;democracy. It got me
on fire. Democracy means that everybody in
America is going to be with everybody alike.”</p>

<p>“Och! Stop your dreaming out of your head.
Close up your mouth from your foolishness.
Women got long hair and small brains,” he
finished, muttering as he went to bed.</p>

<p>At the busy gossiping hour of the following
morning when the butcher-shop was crowded
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
with women in dressing-sacks and wrappers
covered over with shawls, Hanneh Hayyeh
elbowed her way into the clamorous babel of
her neighbors.</p>

<p>“What are you so burning? What are you so
flaming?”</p>

<p>“She’s always on fire with the wonders of her
son.”</p>

<p>“The whole world must stop still to listen to
what news her son writes to her.”</p>

<p>“She thinks her son is the only one soldier by
the American army.”</p>

<p>“My Benny is also one great wonder from
smartness, but I ain’t such a crazy mother like
she.”</p>

<p>The voices of her neighbors rose from every
corner, but Hanneh Hayyeh, deaf to all, projected
herself forward.</p>

<p>“What are you pushing yourself so wild?
You ain’t going to get your meat first. Ain’t it,
Mr. Sopkin, all got to wait their turn?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sopkin glanced up in the midst of cutting
apart a quarter of meat. He wiped his knife
on his greasy apron and leaned across the counter.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>“Nu? Hanneh Hayyeh?” his ruddy face
beamed. “Have you another letter from little
Aby in France? What good news have you got
to tell us?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;it’s not a letter,” she retorted, with a
gesture of impatience. “The good news is that
I got done with the painting of my kitchen&mdash;and
you all got to come and give a look how it
shines in my house like in a palace.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sopkin resumed cutting the meat.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” clamored Hanneh Hayyeh, with
feverish breathlessness. “Stop with your meat
already and quick come. The store ain’t going
to run away from you! It will take only a minute.
With one step you are upstairs in my
house.” She flung out her hands. “And everybody
got to come along.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I can make a living from
looking on the wonders you turn over in your
house?” remonstrated the butcher, with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Making money ain’t everything in life. My
new-painted kitchen will light up your heart
with joy.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>Seeing that Mr. Sopkin still made no move,
she began to coax and wheedle, woman-fashion.
“Oi weh! Mr. Sopkin! Don’t be so mean. Come
only. Your customers ain’t going to run away
from you. If they do, they only got to come
back, because you ain’t a skinner. You weigh
the meat honest.”</p>

<p>How could Mr. Sopkin resist such seductive
flattery?</p>

<p>“Hanneh Hayyeh!” he laughed. “You’re
crazy up in the air, but nobody can say no to
anything you take into your head.”</p>

<p>He tossed his knife down on the counter.
“Everybody!” he called; “let us do her the
pleasure and give a look on what she got to
show us.”</p>

<p>“Oi weh! I ain’t got no time,” protested one.
“I left my baby alone in the house locked in.”</p>

<p>“And I left a pot of eating on the stove boiling.
It must be all burned away by this time.”</p>

<p>“But you all got time to stand around here
and chatter like a box of monkeys, for hours,”
admonished Mr. Sopkin. “This will only take a
minute. You know Hanneh Hayyeh. We can’t
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
tear ourselves away from her till we do what
wills itself in her mind.”</p>

<p>Protesting and gesticulating, they all followed
Mr. Sopkin as Hanneh Hayyeh led the
way. Through the hallway of a dark, ill-smelling
tenement, up two flights of crooked, rickety
stairs, they filed. When Hanneh Hayyeh
opened the door there were exclamations of
wonder and joy: “Oi! Oi!” and “Ay! Ay!
Takeh! Takeh!”</p>

<p>“Gold is shining from every corner!”</p>

<p>“Like for a holiday!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to light up the gas, so it
shines!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could only have it so grand!”</p>

<p>“You ain’t got worries on your head, so it
lays in your mind to make it so fancy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sopkin stood with mouth open, stunned
with wonder at the transformation.</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh shook him by the sleeve
exultantly. “Nu? Why ain’t you saying something?”</p>

<p>“Grand ain’t the word for it! What a whiteness!
And what a cleanliness! It tears out the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
eyes from the head! Such a tenant the landlord
ought to give out a medal or let down the
rent free. I saw the rooms before and I see them
now. What a difference from one house to
another.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you coming in?” Hanneh Hayyeh besought
her neighbors.</p>

<p>“God from the world! To step with our feet
on this new painted floor?”</p>

<p>“Shah!” said the butcher, taking off his apron
and spreading it on the floor. “You can all give
a step on my apron. It’s dirty, anyhow.”</p>

<p>They crowded in on the outspread apron
and vied with one another in their words of
praise.</p>

<p>“May you live to see your son married from
this kitchen, and may we all be invited to the
wedding!”</p>

<p>“May you live to eat here cake and wine on
the feasts of your grandchildren!”</p>

<p>“May you have the luck to get rich and move
from here into your own bought house!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” breathed Hanneh Hayyeh. “May
we all forget from our worries for rent!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>Mrs. Preston followed with keen delight
Hanneh Hayyeh’s every movement as she
lifted the wash from the basket and spread it on
the bed. Hanneh Hayyeh’s rough, toil-worn
hands lingered lovingly, caressingly over each
garment. It was as though the fabrics held
something subtly animate in their texture that
penetrated to her very finger-tips.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Hayyeh! You’re an artist!” There
was reverence in Mrs. Preston’s low voice that
pierced the other woman’s inmost being. “You
do my laces and batistes as no one else ever has.
It’s as if you breathed part of your soul into
it.”</p>

<p>The hungry-eyed, ghetto woman drank in
thirstily the beauty and goodness that radiated
from Mrs. Preston’s person. None of the cultured
elegance of her adored friend escaped
Hanneh Hayyeh. Her glance traveled from the
exquisite shoes to the flawless hair of the well-poised
head.</p>

<p>“Your things got so much fineness. I’m crazy
for the feel from them. I do them up so light in
my hands like it was thin air I was handling.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>Hanneh Hayyeh pantomimed as she spoke
and Mrs. Preston, roused from her habitual
reserve, put her fine, white hand affectionately
over Hanneh Hayyeh’s gnarled, roughened
ones.</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i-i! Mrs. Preston! You always make me
feel so grand!” said Hanneh Hayyeh, a mist of
tears in her wistful eyes. “When I go away from
you I could just sit down and cry. I can’t give
it out in words what it is. It chokes me so&mdash;how
good you are to me&mdash;You ain’t at all like
a rich lady. You’re so plain from the heart. You
make the lowest nobody feel he’s somebody.”</p>

<p>“You are not a ‘nobody,’ Hanneh Hayyeh.
You are an artist&mdash;an artist laundress.”</p>

<p>“What mean you an artist?”</p>

<p>“An artist is so filled with love for the beautiful
that he has to express it in some way. You
express it in your washing just as a painter
paints it in a picture.”</p>

<p>“Paint?” exclaimed Hanneh Hayyeh. “If
you could only give a look how I painted up my
kitchen! It lights up the whole tenement house
for blocks around. The grocer and the butcher
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
and all the neighbors were jumping in the air
from wonder and joy when they seen how I
shined up my house.”</p>

<p>“And all in honor of Aby’s home-coming?”
Mrs. Preston smiled, her thoughts for a moment
on her own son, the youngest captain in his
regiment whose home-coming had been delayed
from week to week.</p>

<p>“Everything I do is done for my Aby,”
breathed Hanneh Hayyeh, her hands clasping
her bosom as if feeling again the throb of his
babyhood at her heart. “But this painting was
already dreaming itself in my head for years.
You remember the time the hot iron fell on my
foot and you came to see me and brought me a
red flower-pot wrapped around with green crêpe
paper? That flower-pot opened up the sky in my
kitchen.” The words surged from the seething
soul of her. “Right away I saw before my eyes
how I could shine up my kitchen like a parlor by
painting the walls and sewing up new curtains for
the window. It was like seeing before me your
face every time I looked on your flowers. I used
to talk to it like it could hear and feel and see.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
And I said to it: ‘I’ll show you what’s in me.
I’ll show you that I know what beautiful is.’”</p>

<p>Her face was aglow with an enthusiasm that
made it seem young, like a young girl’s face.</p>

<p>“I begged myself by the landlord to paint up
my kitchen, but he wouldn’t listen to me. So I
seen that if I ever hoped to fix up my house, I’d
have to spend out my own money. And I began
to save a penny to a penny to have for the
paint. And when I seen the painters, I always
stopped them to ask where and how to buy
it so that it should come out the cheapest. By
day and by night it burned in me the picture&mdash;my
kitchen shining all white like yours, till I
couldn’t rest till I done it.”</p>

<p>With all her breeding, with all the restraint
of her Anglo-Saxon forbears, Mrs. Preston was
strangely shaken by Hanneh Hayyeh’s consuming
passion for beauty. She looked deep into the
eyes of the Russian Jewess as if drinking in the
secret of their hidden glow.</p>

<p>“I am eager to see that wonderful kitchen of
yours,” she said, as Hanneh Hayyeh bade her
good-bye.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>Hanneh Hayyeh walked home, her thoughts
in a whirl with the glad anticipation of Mrs.
Preston’s promised visit. She wondered how
she might share the joy of Mrs. Preston’s
presence with the butcher and all the neighbors.
“I’ll bake up a shtrudel cake,” she thought to
herself. “They will all want to come to get a
taste of the cake and then they’ll give a look on
Mrs. Preston.”</p>

<p>Thus smiling and talking to herself she went
about her work. As she bent over the wash-tub
rubbing the clothes, she visualized the hot,
steaming shtrudel just out of the oven and the
exclamations of pleasure as Mrs. Preston and
the neighbors tasted it. All at once there was
a knock at the door. Wiping her soapy hands
on the corner of her apron, she hastened to
open it.</p>

<p>“Oi! Mr. Landlord! Come only inside,” she
urged. “I got the rent for you, but I want you
to give a look around how I shined up my flat.”</p>

<p>The Prince Albert that bound the protruding
stomach of Mr. Benjamin Rosenblatt was no
tighter than the skin that encased the smooth-shaven
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>
face. His mouth was tight. Even the
small, popping eyes held a tight gleam.</p>

<p>“I got no time. The minutes is money,” he
said, extending a claw-like hand for the rent.</p>

<p>“But I only want you for a half a minute.”
And Hanneh Hayyeh dragged the owner of her
palace across the threshold. “Nu? Ain’t I a
good painter? And all this I done while other
people were sleeping themselves, after I’d come
home from my day’s work.”</p>

<p>“Very nice,” condescended Mr. Benjamin
Rosenblatt, with a hasty glance around the
room. “You certainly done a good job. But I
got to go. Here’s your receipt.” And the fingers
that seized Hanneh Hayyeh’s rent-money
seemed like pincers for grasping molars.</p>

<p>Two weeks later Jake Safransky and his wife
Hanneh Hayyeh sat eating their dinner, when
the janitor came in with a note.</p>

<p>“From the landlord,” he said, handing it to
Hanneh Hayyeh, and walked out.</p>

<p>“The landlord?” she cried, excitedly. “What
for can it be?” With trembling fingers she tore
open the note. The slip dropped from her hand.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
Her face grew livid, her eyes bulged with terror.
“Oi weh!” she exclaimed, as she fell back
against the wall.</p>

<p>“Gewalt!” cried her husband, seizing her
limp hand, “you look like struck dead.”</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! The murderer! He raised me the rent
five dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Good for you! I told you to listen to me.
Maybe he thinks we got money laying in the
bank when you got so many dollars to give out
on paint.”</p>

<p>She turned savagely on her husband. “What
are you tearing yet my flesh? Such a money-grabber!
How could I imagine for myself that
so he would thank me for laying in my money
to painting up his house?”</p>

<p>She seized her shawl, threw it over her head,
and rushed to the landlord’s office.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! Mr. Landlord! Where is your heart?
How could you raise me my rent when you
know my son is yet in France? And even with
the extra washing I take in I don’t get enough
when the eating is so dear?”</p>

<p>“The flat is worth five dollars more,” answered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
Mr. Rosenblatt, impatiently. “I can
get another tenant any minute.”</p>

<p>“Have pity on me! I beg you! From where I
can squeeze out the five dollars more for you?”</p>

<p>“That don’t concern me. If you can’t pay,
somebody else will. I got to look out for myself.
In America everybody looks out for
himself.”</p>

<p>“Is it nothing by you how I painted up your
house with my own blood-money?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t do it for me. You done it for
yourself,” he sneered. “It’s nothing to me how
the house looks, so long as I get my rent in time.
You wanted to have a swell house, so you
painted it. That’s all.”</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he dismissed her.</p>

<p>“I beg by your conscience! Think on God!”
Hanneh Hayyeh wrung her hands. “Ain’t
your house worth more to you to have a tenant
clean it out and paint it out so beautiful like I
done?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” snarled the landlord. “Because
the flat is painted new, I can get more money
for it. I got no more time for you.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>He turned to his stenographer and resumed
the dictation of his letters.</p>

<p>Dazedly Hanneh Hayyeh left the office. A
choking dryness contracted her throat as she
staggered blindly, gesticulating and talking to
herself.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! The sweat, the money I laid into
my flat and it should all go to the devil. And I
should be turned out and leave all my beautifulness.
And from where will I get the money for
moving? When I begin to break myself up to
move, I got to pay out money for the moving
man, money for putting up new lines, money for
new shelves and new hooks besides money for
the rent. I got to remain where I am. But from
where can I get together the five dollars for the
robber? Should I go to Moisheh Itzek, the pawnbroker,
or should I maybe ask Mrs. Preston?
No&mdash;She shouldn’t think I got her for a friend
only to help me. Oi weh! Where should I turn
with my bitter heart?”</p>

<p>Mechanically she halted at the butcher-shop.
Throwing herself on the vacant bench, she buried
her face in her shawl and burst out in a loud,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
heart-piercing wail: “Woe is me! Bitter is me!”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Hayyeh! What to you happened?”
cried Mr. Sopkin in alarm.</p>

<p>His sympathy unlocked the bottom depths of
her misery.</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! Black is my luck! Dark is for my
eyes!”</p>

<p>The butcher and the neighbors pressed close
in upon her.</p>

<p>“Gewalt! What is it? Bad news from Aby in
France?”</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! The murderer! The thief! His gall
should burst as mine is bursting! His heart
should break as mine is breaking! It remains for
me nothing but to be thrown out in the gutter.
The landlord raised me five dollars a month rent.
And he ripped yet my wounds by telling me he
raised me the rent because my painted-up flat
is so much more worth.”</p>

<p>“The dogs! The blood-sucking landlords!
They are the new czars from America!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“What should I do? Aby is coming from
France any day, and he’s got to have a home to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
come to. I will have to take out from my eating
the meat and the milk to save together the extra
five dollars. People! Give me an advice! What
else can I do? If a wild wolf falls on you in the
black night, will crying help you?”</p>

<p>With a gesture of abject despair, she fell prone
upon the bench. “Gottuniu! If there is any justice
and mercy on this earth, then may the landlord
be tortured like he is torturing me! May
the fires burn him and the waters drown him!
May his flesh be torn from him in pieces and his
bones be ground in the teeth of wild dogs!”</p>

<p>Two months later, a wasted, haggard Hanneh
Hayyeh stood in the kitchen, folding Mrs.
Preston’s wash in her basket, when the janitor&mdash;the
servant of her oppressor&mdash;handed her
another note.</p>

<p>“From the landlord,” he said in his toneless
voice.</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh paled. She could tell from
his smirking sneer that it was a second notice
of increased rental.</p>

<p>It grew black before her eyes. She was too
stunned to think. Her first instinct was to run
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>
to her husband; but she needed sympathy&mdash;not
nagging. And then in her darkness she saw a
light&mdash;the face of her friend, Mrs. Preston.
She hurried to her.</p>

<p>“Oi&mdash;friend! The landlord raised me my rent
again,” she gasped, dashing into the room like a
thing hounded by wild beasts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Preston was shocked by Hanneh Hayyeh’s
distraught appearance. For the first time
she noticed the ravages of worry and hunger.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Hayyeh! Try to calm yourself. It is
really quite inexcusable the way the landlords
are taking advantage of the situation. There
must be a way out. We’ll fix it up somehow.”</p>

<p>“How fix it up?” Hanneh Hayyeh flared.</p>

<p>“We’ll see that you get the rent you need.”
There was reassurance and confidence in Mrs.
Preston’s tone.</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh’s eyes flamed. Too choked
for utterance, her breath ceased for a moment.</p>

<p>“I want no charity! You think maybe I came
to beg? No&mdash;I want justice!”</p>

<p>She shrank in upon herself, as though to ward
off the raised whip of her persecutor. “You know
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
how I feel?” Her voice came from the terrified
depths of her. “It’s as if the landlord pushed
me in a corner and said to me: ‘I want money,
or I’ll squeeze from you your life!’ I have no
money, so he takes my life.</p>

<p>“Last time, when he raised me my rent, I
done without meat and without milk. What
more can I do without?”</p>

<p>The piercing cry stirred Mrs. Preston as no
mere words had done.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I get so weak for a piece of meat,
I could tear the world to pieces. Hunger and
bitterness are making a wild animal out of me.
I ain’t no more the same Hanneh Hayyeh I used
to be.”</p>

<p>The shudder that shook Hanneh Hayyeh
communicated itself to Mrs. Preston. “I know
the prices are hard to bear,” she stammered,
appalled.</p>

<p>“There used to be a time when poor people
could eat cheap things,” the toneless voice went
on. “But now there ain’t no more cheap things.
Potatoes&mdash;rice&mdash;fish&mdash;even dry bread is
dear. Look on my shoes! And I who used to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
so neat with myself. I can’t no more have my
torn shoes fixed up. A pair of shoes or a little
patch is only for millionaires.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done,” broke in Mrs.
Preston, distraught for the first time in her life.
“But in the meantime, Hanneh Hayyeh, you
must accept this to tide you over.” She spoke
with finality as she handed her a bill.</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh thrust back the money.
“Ain’t I hurt enough without you having to
hurt me yet with charity? You want to give me
hush money to swallow down an unrightness
that burns my flesh? I want justice.”</p>

<p>The woman’s words were like bullets that
shot through the static security of Mrs. Preston’s
life. She realized with a guilty pang that
while strawberries and cream were being served
at her table in January, Hanneh Hayyeh had
doubtless gone without a square meal in months.</p>

<p>“We can’t change the order of things overnight,”
faltered Mrs. Preston, baffled and bewildered
by Hanneh Hayyeh’s defiance of her
proffered aid.</p>

<p>“Change things? There’s got to be a change!”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
cried Hanneh Hayyeh with renewed intensity.
“The world as it is is not to live in any longer.
If only my Aby would get back quick. But until
he comes, I’ll fight till all America will have
to stop and listen to me. You was always telling
me that the lowest nobody got something to
give to America. And that’s what I got to give
to America&mdash;the last breath in my body for
justice. I’ll wake up America from its sleep. I’ll
go myself to the President with my Aby’s soldier
picture and ask him was all this war to let
loose a bunch of blood-suckers to suck the marrow
out from the people?”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Hayyeh,” said Mrs. Preston, with
feeling, “these laws are far from just, but they
are all we have so far. Give us time. We are young.
We are still learning. We’re doing our best.”</p>

<p>Numb with suffering the woman of the ghetto
looked straight into the eyes of Mrs. Preston.
“And you too&mdash;you too hold by the landlord’s
side?&mdash;Oi&mdash;I see! Perhaps you too got property
out by agents.”</p>

<p>A sigh that had in it the resignation of utter
hopelessness escaped from her. “Nothing can
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
hurt me no more&mdash;And you always stood out
to me in my dreams as the angel from love and
beautifulness. You always made-believe to me
that you’re only for democracy.”</p>

<p>Tears came to Mrs. Preston’s eyes. But she
made no move to defend herself or reply and
Hanneh Hayyeh walked out in silence.</p>

<p>A few days later the whole block was astir
with the news that Hanneh Hayyeh had gone
to court to answer her dispossess summons.</p>

<p>From the windows, the stoop, from the hallway,
and the doorway of the butcher-shop the
neighbors were talking and gesticulating while
waiting for Hanneh Hayyeh’s return.</p>

<p>Hopeless and dead, Hanneh Hayyeh dragged
herself to the butcher-shop. All made way for
her to sit on the bench. She collapsed in a heap,
not uttering a single sound, nor making a single
move.</p>

<p>The butcher produced a bottle of brandy and,
hastily filling a small glass, brought it to Hanneh
Hayyeh.</p>

<p>“Quick, take it to your lips,” he commanded.
Weak from lack of food and exhausted by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
the ordeal of the court-room, Hanneh Hayyeh
obeyed like a child.</p>

<p>Soon one neighbor came in with a cup of hot
coffee; another brought bread and herring with
onion over it.</p>

<p>Tense, breathless, with suppressed curiosity
quivering on their lips, they waited till Hanneh
Hayyeh swallowed the coffee and ate enough to
regain a little strength.</p>

<p>“Nu? What became in the court?”</p>

<p>“What said the judge?”</p>

<p>“Did they let you talk yourself out like you
said you would?”</p>

<p>“Was the murderer there to say something?”</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh wagged her head and began
talking to herself in a low, toneless voice as if
continuing her inward thought. “The judge
said the same as Mrs. Preston said: the landlord
has the right to raise our rent or put us out.”</p>

<p>“Oi weh! If Hanneh Hayyeh with her fire in
her mouth couldn’t get her rights, then where
are we?”</p>

<p>“To whom should we go? Who more will talk
for us now?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>“Our life lays in their hands.”</p>

<p>“They can choke us so much as they like!”</p>

<p>“Nobody cares. Nobody hears our cry!”</p>

<p>Out of this babel of voices there flashed
across Hanneh Hayyeh’s deadened senses the
chimera that to her was the one reality of her aspiring
soul&mdash;“Oi-i-i-i! My beautiful kitchen!”
she sighed as in a dream.</p>

<p>The butcher’s face grew red with wrath. His
eyes gleamed like sharp, darting steel. “I
wouldn’t give that robber the satisfaction to
leave your grand painted house,” he said, turning
to Hanneh Hayyeh. “I’d smash down everything
for spite. You got nothing to lose. Such a
murderer! I would learn him a lesson! ‘An eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’”</p>

<p>Hanneh Hayyeh, hair disheveled, clothes
awry, the nails of her fingers dug in her scalp,
stared with the glazed, impotent stare of a madwoman.
With unseeing eyes she rose and blindly
made her way to her house.</p>

<p>As she entered her kitchen she encountered
her husband hurrying in.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! Oi weh!” he whined. “I was always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
telling you your bad end. Everybody is already
pointing their fingers on me! and all because
you, a meshugeneh yideneh, a starved beggerin,
talked it into your head that you got to have
for yourself a white-painted kitchen alike to Mrs.
Preston. Now you’ll remember to listen to your
husband. Now, when you’ll be laying in the
street to shame and to laughter for the whole
world.”</p>

<p>“Out! Out from my sight! Out from my
house!” shrieked Hanneh Hayyeh. In her rage
she seized a flat-iron and Jake heard her hurl
it at the slammed door as he fled downstairs.</p>

<p>It was the last night before the eviction.
Hanneh Hayyeh gazed about her kitchen with
tear-glazed eyes. “Some one who got nothing
but only money will come in here and get the
pleasure from all this beautifulness that cost
me the blood from my heart. Is this already
America? What for was my Aby fighting? Was
it then only a dream&mdash;all these millions people
from all lands and from all times, wishing and
hoping and praying that America is? Did I
wake myself from my dreaming to see myself
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
back in the black times of Russia under the
czar?”</p>

<p>Her eager, beauty-loving face became distorted
with hate. “No&mdash;the landlord ain’t
going to get the best from me! I’ll learn him a
lesson. ‘An eye for an eye’&mdash;”</p>

<p>With savage fury, she seized the chopping-axe
and began to scratch down the paint, breaking
the plaster on the walls. She tore up the floor-boards.
She unscrewed the gas-jets, turned on
the gas full force so as to blacken the white-painted
ceiling. The night through she raged
with the frenzy of destruction.</p>

<p>Utterly spent she flung herself on the lounge,
but she could not close her eyes. Her nerves
quivered. Her body ached, and she felt her soul
ache there&mdash;inside her&mdash;like a thing killed
that could not die.</p>

<p>The first grayness of dawn filtered through
the air-shaft window of the kitchen. The room
was faintly lighted, and as the rays of dawn got
stronger and reached farther, one by one the
things she had mutilated in the night started, as
it were, into consciousness. She looked at her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
dish-closet, once precious, that she had scratched
and defaced; the uprooted geranium-box on the
window-sill; the marred walls. It was unbearable
all this waste and desolation that stared at her.
“Can it be I who done all this?” she asked herself.
“What devil got boiling in me?”</p>

<p>What had she gained by her rage for vengeance?
She had thought to spite the landlord,
but it was her own soul she had killed. These
walls that stared at her in their ruin were not
just walls. They were animate&mdash;they throbbed
with the pulse of her own flesh. For every inch
of the broken plaster there was a scar on her
heart. She had destroyed that which had taken
her so many years of prayer and longing to
build up. But this demolished beauty like her
own soul, though killed, still quivered and
ached with the unstilled pain of life. “Oi weh!”
she moaned, swaying to and fro. “So much lost
beautifulness&mdash;”</p>

<p>Private Abraham Safransky, with the look in
his eyes and the swing of his shoulders of all the
boys who come back from overseas, edged his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
way through the wet Delancey Street crowds
with the skill of one born to these streets and the
assurance of the United States Army. Fresh
from the ship, with a twenty-four-hour leave

surprise her in her spotless kitchen, the soldier
broke into the double-quick.</p>

<p>All at once he stopped; on the sidewalk before

a woman huddled, cowering, broken.&mdash;Good

their worldly belongings dumped there in the

<div class="chapter">
  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>THE FREE VACATION HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">How</span> came it that I went to the free vacation
house was like this:</p>

<p>One day the visiting teacher from the school
comes to find out for why don’t I get the children
ready for school in time; for why are they
so often late.</p>

<p>I let out on her my whole bitter heart. I told
her my head was on wheels from worrying.
When I get up in the morning, I don’t know on
what to turn first: should I nurse the baby, or
make Sam’s breakfast, or attend on the older
children. I only got two hands.</p>

<p>“My dear woman,” she says, “you are about
to have a nervous breakdown. You need to
get away to the country for a rest and vacation.”</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel!” says I. “Don’t I know
I need a rest? But how? On what money can I
go to the country?”</p>

<p>“I know of a nice country place for mothers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
and children that will not cost you anything. It
is free.”</p>

<p>“Free! I never heard from it.”</p>

<p>“Some kind people have made arrangements
so no one need pay,” she explains.</p>

<p>Later, in a few days, I just finished up with
Masha and Mendel and Frieda and Sonya to
send them to school, and I was getting Aby
ready for kindergarten, when I hear a knock on
the door, and a lady comes in. She had a white
starched dress like a nurse and carried a black
satchel in her hand.</p>

<p>“I am from the Social Betterment Society,”
she tells me. “You want to go to the country?”</p>

<p>Before I could say something, she goes over
to the baby and pulls out the rubber nipple
from her mouth, and to me, she says, “You
must not get the child used to sucking this; it is
very unsanitary.”</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel!” I beg the lady. “Please
don’t begin with that child, or she’ll holler my
head off. She must have the nipple. I’m too
nervous to hear her scream like that.”</p>

<p>When I put the nipple back again in the baby’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
mouth, the lady takes herself a seat, and then
takes out a big black book from her satchel.
Then she begins to question me. What is my
first name? How old I am? From where come I?
How long I’m already in this country? Do I
keep any boarders? What is my husband’s first
name? How old he is? How long he is in this
country? By what trade he works? How much
wages he gets for a week? How much money do
I spend out for rent? How old are the children,
and everything about them.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” I cry out. “For why is it
necessary all this to know? For why must I tell
you all my business? What difference does it
make already if I keep boarders, or I don’t keep
boarders? If Masha had the whooping-cough or
Sonya had the measles? Or whether I spend out
for my rent ten dollars or twenty? Or whether
I come from Schnipishock or Kovner Gubernie?”</p>

<p>“We must make a record of all the applicants,
and investigate each case,” she tells me. “There
are so many who apply to the charities, we can
help only those who are most worthy.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>“Charities!” I scream out. “Ain’t the charities
those who help the beggars out? I ain’t
no beggar. I’m not asking for no charity. My
husband, he works.”</p>

<p>“Miss Holcomb, the visiting teacher, said
that you wanted to go to the country, and I had
to make out this report before investigating
your case.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” I choke and bit my lips. “Is the
free country from which Miss Holcomb told me,
is it from the charities? She was telling me some
kind people made arrangements for any mother
what needs to go there.”</p>

<p>“If your application is approved, you will be
notified,” she says to me, and out she goes.</p>

<p>When she is gone I think to myself, I’d better
knock out from my head this idea about the
country. For so long I lived, I didn’t know
nothing about the charities. For why should I
come down among the beggars now?</p>

<p>Then I looked around me in the kitchen.
On one side was the big wash-tub with clothes,
waiting for me to wash. On the table was a
pile of breakfast dishes yet. In the sink was the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
potatoes, waiting to be peeled. The baby was
beginning to cry for the bottle. Aby was hollering
and pulling me to take him to kindergarten. I
felt if I didn’t get away from here for a little
while, I would land in a crazy house, or from the
window jump down. Which was worser, to land
in a crazy house, jump from the window down,
or go to the country from the charities?</p>

<p>In about two weeks later around comes the
same lady with the satchel again in my house.</p>

<p>“You can go to the country to-morrow,” she
tells me. “And you must come to the charity
building to-morrow at nine o’clock sharp. Here
is a card with the address. Don’t lose it, because
you must hand it to the lady in the office.”</p>

<p>I look on the card, and there I see my name
wrote; and by it, in big printed letters, that
word “<span class="small-caps">Charity</span>.”</p>

<p>“Must I go to the charity office?” I ask, feeling
my heart to sink. “For why must I come there?”</p>

<p>“It is the rule that everybody comes to the
office first, and from there they are taken to the
country.”</p>

<p>I shivered to think how I would feel, suppose
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
somebody from my friends should see me walking
into the charity office with my children.
They wouldn’t know that it is only for the
country I go there. They might think I go to
beg. Have I come down so low as to be seen by
the charities? But what’s the use? Should I
knock my head on the walls? I had to go.</p>

<p>When I come to the office, I already found a
crowd of women and children sitting on long
benches and waiting. I took myself a seat with
them, and we were sitting and sitting and looking
on one another, sideways and crosswise, and
with lowered eyes, like guilty criminals. Each
one felt like hiding herself from all the rest.
Each one felt black with shame in the face.</p>

<p>We may have been sitting and waiting for an
hour or more. But every second was seeming
years to me. The children began to get restless.
Mendel wanted water. The baby on my arms
was falling asleep. Aby was crying for something
to eat.</p>

<p>“For why are we sittin’ here like fat cats?”
says the woman next to me. “Ain’t we going to
the country to-day yet?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>At last a lady comes to the desk and begins
calling us our names, one by one. I nearly
dropped to the floor when over she begins to
ask: Do you keep boarders? How much do
you spend out for rent? How much wages does
your man get for a week?</p>

<p>Didn’t the nurse tell them all about us already?
It was bitter enough to have to tell the
nurse everything, but in my own house nobody
was hearing my troubles, only the nurse. But in
the office there was so many strangers all around
me. For why should everybody have to know
my business? At every question I wanted to
holler out: “Stop! Stop! I don’t want no vacations!
I’ll better run home with my children.”
At every question I felt like she was stabbing a
knife into my heart. And she kept on stabbing
me more and more, but I could not help it, and
they were all looking at me. I couldn’t move
from her. I had to answer everything.</p>

<p>When she got through with me, my face was
red like fire. I was burning with hurts and
wounds. I felt like everything was bleeding in me.</p>

<p>When all the names was already called, a man
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
doctor with a nurse comes in, and tells us to
form a line, to be examined. I wish I could ease
out my heart a little, and tell in words how that
doctor looked on us, just because we were poor
and had no money to pay. He only used the
ends from his finger-tips to examine us with.
From the way he was afraid to touch us or come
near us, he made us feel like we had some catching
sickness that he was trying not to get on
him.</p>

<p>The doctor got finished with us in about five
minutes, so quick he worked. Then we was told
to walk after the nurse, who was leading the
way for us through the street to the car. Everybody
what passed us in the street turned around
to look on us. I kept down my eyes and held
down my head and I felt like sinking into the
sidewalk. All the time I was trembling for fear
somebody what knows me might yet pass and
see me. For why did they make us walk through
the street, after the nurse, like stupid cows?
Weren’t all of us smart enough to find our way
without the nurse? Why should the whole world
have to see that we are from the charities?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>When we got into the train, I opened my
eyes, and lifted up my head, and straightened
out my chest, and again began to breathe. It
was a beautiful, sunshiny day. I knocked open
the window from the train, and the fresh-smelling
country air rushed upon my face and made
me feel so fine! I looked out from the window
and instead of seeing the iron fire-escapes with
garbage-cans and bedclothes, that I always seen
when from my flat I looked&mdash;instead of seeing
only walls and wash-lines between walls, I saw
the blue sky, and green grass and trees and
flowers.</p>

<p>Ah, how grand I felt, just on the sky to look!
Ah, how grand I felt just to see the green grass&mdash;and
the free space&mdash;and no houses!</p>

<p>“Get away from me, my troubles!” I said.
“Leave me rest a minute. Leave me breathe
and straighten out my bones. Forget the unpaid
butcher’s bill. Forget the rent. Forget the
wash-tub and the cook-stove and the pots and
pans. Forget the charities!”</p>

<p>“Tickets, please,” calls the train conductor.</p>

<p>I felt knocked out from heaven all at once. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
had to point to the nurse what held our tickets,
and I was feeling the conductor looking on me
as if to say, “Oh, you are only from the charities.”</p>

<p>By the time we came to the vacation house
I already forgot all about my knock-down. I
was again filled with the beauty of the country.
I never in all my life yet seen such a swell house
like that vacation house. Like the grandest
palace it looked. All round the front, flowers
from all colors was smelling out the sweetest
perfume. Here and there was shady trees with
comfortable chairs under them to sit down on.</p>

<p>When I only came inside, my mouth opened
wide and my breathing stopped still from wonder.
I never yet seen such an order and such a
cleanliness. From all the corners from the room,
the cleanliness was shining like a looking-glass.
The floor was so white scrubbed you could eat
on it. You couldn’t find a speck of dust on
nothing, if you was looking for it with eye-glasses
on.</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel happy and glad that
I come, when, Gott im Himmel! again a lady
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
begins to ask us out the same questions what
the nurse already asked me in my home and
what was asked over again in the charity office.
How much wages my husband makes out for a
week? How much money I spend out for rent?
Do I keep boarders?</p>

<p>We were hungry enough to faint. So worn out
was I from excitement, and from the long ride,
that my knees were bending under me ready to
break from tiredness. The children were pulling
me to pieces, nagging me for a drink, for something
to eat and such like. But still we had to
stand out the whole list of questionings. When
she already got through asking us out everything,
she gave to each of us a tag with our
name written on it. She told us to tie the tag on
our hand. Then like tagged horses at a horse
sale in the street, they marched us into the
dining-room.</p>

<p>There was rows of long tables, covered with
pure-white oil-cloth. A vase with bought flowers
was standing on the middle from each table.
Each person got a clean napkin for himself.
Laid out by the side from each person’s plate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
was a silver knife and fork and spoon and teaspoon.
When we only sat ourselves down, girls
with white starched aprons was passing around
the eatings.</p>

<p>I soon forgot again all my troubles. For the
first time in ten years I sat down to a meal what
I did not have to cook or worry about. For the
first time in ten years I sat down to the table
like a somebody. Ah, how grand it feels, to have
handed you over the eatings and everything
you need. Just as I was beginning to like it and
let myself feel good, in comes a fat lady all in
white, with a teacher’s look on her face. I could
tell already, right away by the way she looked
on us, that she was the boss from this place.</p>

<p>“I want to read you the rules from this house,
before you leave this room,” says she to us.</p>

<p>Then she began like this: We dassen’t stand
on the front grass where the flowers are. We
dassen’t stay on the front porch. We dassen’t
sit on the chairs under the shady trees. We must
stay always in the back and sit on those long
wooden benches there. We dassen’t come in the
front sitting-room or walk on the front steps
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>
what have carpet on it&mdash;we must walk on the
back iron steps. Everything on the front from
the house must be kept perfect for the show for
visitors. We dassen’t lay down on the beds in
the daytime, the beds must always be made up
perfect for the show for visitors.</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel!” thinks I to myself;
“ain’t there going to be no end to the things we
dassen’t do in this place?”</p>

<p>But still she went on. The children over two
years dassen’t stay around by the mothers.
They must stay by the nurse in the play-room.
By the meal-times, they can see their mothers.
The children dassen’t run around the house or
tear up flowers or do anything. They dassen’t
holler or play rough in the play-room. They
must always behave and obey the nurse.</p>

<p>We must always listen to the bells. Bell one
was for getting up. Bell two, for getting babies’
bottles. Bell three, for coming to breakfast.
Bell four, for bathing the babies. If we come
later, after the ring from the bell, then we’ll
not get what we need. If the bottle bell rings
and we don’t come right away for the bottle,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
then the baby don’t get no bottle. If the breakfast
bell rings, and we don’t come right away
down to the breakfast, then there won’t be no
breakfast for us.</p>

<p>When she got through with reading the rules,
I was wondering which side of the house I was
to walk on. At every step was some rule what
said don’t move here, and don’t go there, don’t
stand there, and don’t sit there. If I tried to
remember the endless rules, it would only make
me dizzy in the head. I was thinking for why,
with so many rules, didn’t they also have already
another rule, about how much air in our
lungs to breathe.</p>

<p>On every few days there came to the house
swell ladies in automobiles. It was for them
that the front from the house had to be always
perfect. For them was all the beautiful smelling
flowers. For them the front porch, the front
sitting-room, and the easy stairs with the carpet
on it.</p>

<p>Always when the rich ladies came the fat
lady, what was the boss from the vacation house,
showed off to them the front. Then she took
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
them over to the back to look on us, where we
was sitting together, on long wooden benches,
like prisoners. I was always feeling cheap like
dirt, and mad that I had to be there, when they
smiled down on us.</p>

<p>“How nice for these poor creatures to have a
restful place like this,” I heard one lady say.</p>

<p>The next day I already felt like going back.
The children what had to stay by the nurse in
the play-room didn’t like it neither.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” says Mendel to me, “I wisht I
was home and out in the street. They don’t let
us do nothing here. It’s worser than school.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it a play-room?” asks I. “Don’t they
let you play?”</p>

<p>“Gee wiss! play-room, they call it! The nurse
hollers on us all the time. She don’t let us do
nothing.”</p>

<p>The reason why I stayed out the whole two
weeks is this: I think to myself, so much shame
in the face I suffered to come here, let me at
least make the best from it already. Let me at
least save up for two weeks what I got to spend
out for grocery and butcher for my back bills to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
pay out. And then also think I to myself, if I go
back on Monday, I got to do the big washing; on
Tuesday waits for me the ironing; on Wednesday,
the scrubbing and cleaning, and so goes it
on. How bad it is already in this place, it’s a
change from the very same sameness of what
I’m having day in and day out at home. And so
I stayed out this vacation to the bitter end.</p>

<p>But at last the day for going out from this
prison came. On the way riding back, I kept
thinking to myself: “This is such a beautiful
vacation house. For why do they make it so
hard for us? When a mother needs a vacation,
why must they tear the insides out from her
first, by making her come down to the charity
office? Why drag us from the charity office
through the streets? And when we live through
the shame of the charities and when we come
already to the vacation house, for why do they
boss the life out of us with so many rules and
bells? For why don’t they let us lay down our
heads on the bed when we are tired? For why
must we always stick in the back, like dogs what
have got to be chained in one spot? If they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
would let us walk around free, would we bite off
something from the front part of the house?</p>

<p>“If the best part of the house what is comfortable
is made up for a show for visitors, why
ain’t they keeping the whole business for a
show for visitors? For why do they have to
fool in worn-out mothers, to make them think
they’ll give them a rest? Do they need the
worn-out mothers as part of the show? I guess
that is it, already.”</p>

<p>When I got back in my home, so happy and
thankful I was I could cry from thankfulness.
How good it was feeling for me to be able to
move around my own house, like I pleased. I
was always kicking that my rooms was small
and narrow, but now my small rooms seemed to
grow so big like the park. I looked out from my
window on the fire-escapes, full with bedding
and garbage-cans, and on the wash-lines full
with the clothes. All these ugly things was grand
in my eyes. Even the high brick walls all around
made me feel like a bird what just jumped out
from a cage. And I cried out, “Gott sei dank!
Gott sei dank!”</p>

  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>THE MIRACLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Like</span> all people who have nothing, I lived on
dreams. With nothing but my longing for love,
I burned my way through stone walls till I got
to America. And what happened to me when I
became an American is more than I can picture
before my eyes, even in a dream.</p>

<p>I was a poor Melamid’s daughter in Savel,
Poland. In my village, a girl without a dowry
was a dead one. The only kind of a man that
would give a look on a girl without money was a
widower with a dozen children, or some one with
a hump or on crutches.</p>

<p>There was the village water-carrier with red,
teary eyes, and warts on his cracked lip. There
was the janitor of the bath-house, with a squash
nose, and long, black nails with all the dirt of
the world under them. Maybe one of these uglinesses
might yet take pity on me and do me the
favor to marry me. I shivered and grew cold
through all my bones at the thought of them.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>Like the hunger for bread was my hunger for
love. My life was nothing to me. My heart was
empty. Nothing I did was real without love. I
used to spend nights crying on my pillow, praying
to God: “I want love! I want love! I can’t
live&mdash;I can’t breathe without love!”</p>

<p>And all day long I’d ask myself: “Why was
I born? What is the use of dragging on day after
day, wasting myself eating, sleeping, dressing?
What is the meaning of anything without love?”
And my heart was so hungry I couldn’t help
feeling and dreaming that somehow, somewhere,
there must be a lover waiting for me. But how
and where could I find my lover was the one
longing that burned in my heart by day and by
night.</p>

<p>Then came the letter from Hanneh Hayyeh,
Zlata’s daughter, that fired me up to go to
America for my lover.</p>

<p>“America is a lover’s land,” said Hanneh
Hayyeh’s letter. “In America millionaires fall
in love with poorest girls. Matchmakers are out
of style, and a girl can get herself married to a
man without the worries for a dowry.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>“God from the world!” began knocking my
heart. “How grand to live where the kind of a
man you get don’t depend on how much money
your father can put down! If I could only go to
America! There&mdash;there waits my lover for me.”</p>

<p>That letter made a holiday all over Savel. The
butcher, the grocer, the shoemaker, everybody
stopped his work and rushed to our house to
hear my father read the news from the Golden
Country.</p>

<p>“Stand out your ears to hear my great happiness,”
began Hanneh Hayyeh’s letter. “I, Hanneh
Hayyeh, will marry myself to Solomon
Cohen, the boss from the shirtwaist factory,
where all day I was working sewing on buttons.
If you could only see how the man is melting
away his heart for me! He kisses me after each
step I walk. The only wish from his heart is to
make me for a lady. Think only, he is buying
me a piano! I should learn piano lessons as if
I were from millionaires.”</p>

<p>Fire and lightning burst through the crowd.
“Hanneh Hayyeh a lady!” They nudged and
winked one to the other as they looked on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
loose fatness of Zlata, her mother, and saw before
their eyes Hanneh Hayyeh, with her thick,
red lips, and her shape so fat like a puffed-out
barrel of yeast.</p>

<p>“In America is a law called ‘ladies first,’”
the letter went on. “In the cars the men must
get up to give their seats to the women. The
men hold the babies on their hands and carry
the bundles for the women, and even help with
the dishes. There are not enough women to go
around in America. And the men run after the
women, and not like in Poland, the women running
after the men.”</p>

<p>Gewalt! What an excitement began to burn
through the whole village when they heard of
Hanneh Hayyeh’s luck!</p>

<p>The ticket agents from the ship companies
seeing how Hanneh Hayyeh’s letter was working
like yeast in the air for America, posted up
big signs by all the market fairs: “Go to America,
the New World. Fifty rubles a ticket.”</p>

<p>“Fifty rubles! Only fifty rubles! And there
waits your lover!” cried my heart.</p>

<p>Oi weh! How I was hungering to go to America
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
after that! By day and by night I was tearing
and turning over the earth, how to get to my
lover on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>“Nu, Zalmon?” said my mother, twisting my
father around to what I wanted. “It’s not so
far from sense what Sara Reisel is saying. In
Savel, without a dowry, she had no chance to
get a man, and if we got to wait much longer
she will be too old to get one anywhere.”</p>

<p>“But from where can we get together the
fifty rubles?” asked my father. “Why don’t
it will itself in you to give your daughter the
moon?”</p>

<p>I could no more think on how to get the
money than they. But I was so dying to go,
I felt I could draw the money out from the
sky.</p>

<p>One night I could not fall asleep. I lay in the
darkness and stillness, my wild, beating heart
on fire with dreams of my lover. I put out my
hungry hands and prayed to my lover through
the darkness: “Oh, love, love! How can I get
the fifty rubles to come to you?”</p>

<p>In the morning I got up like one choking for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
air. We were sitting down to eat breakfast, but
I couldn’t taste nothing. I felt my head drop
into my hands from weakness.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try to eat something?”
begged my mother, going over to me.</p>

<p>“Eat?” I cried, jumping up like one mad.
“How can I eat? How can I sleep? How can I
breathe in this deadness? I want to go to America.
I <em>must</em> go, and I <em>will</em> go!”</p>

<p>My mother began wringing her hands. “Oi
weh! Mine heart! The knife is on our neck. The
landlord is hollering for the unpaid rent, and it
wills itself in you America?”</p>

<p>“Are you out of your head?” cried my father.</p>

<p>“What are you dreaming of golden hills on
the sky? How can we get together the fifty
rubles for a ticket?”</p>

<p>I stole a look at Yosef, my younger brother.
Nothing that was sensible ever laid in his head
to do; but if there was anything wild, up in the
air that willed itself in him, he could break
through stone walls to get it. Yosef gave a look
around the house. Everything was old and poor,
and not a thing to get money on&mdash;nothing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
except father’s Saifer Torah&mdash;the Holy Scrolls&mdash;and
mother’s silver candlesticks, her wedding
present from our grandmother.</p>

<p>“Why not sell the Saifer Torah and the candlesticks?”
said Yosef.</p>

<p>Nobody but my brother would have dared to
breathe such a thing.</p>

<p>“What? A Jew sell the Saifer Torah or the
Sabbath candlesticks?” My father fixed on us
his burning eyes like flaming wells. His hands
tightened over his heart. He couldn’t speak.
He just looked on the Saifer Torah, and then
on us with a look that burned like live coals on
our naked bodies. “What?” he gasped. “Should
I sell my life, my soul from generation and generation?
Sell my Saifer Torah? Not if the world
goes under!”</p>

<p>There was a stillness of thunder about to
break. Everybody heard everybody’s heart
beating.</p>

<p>“Did I live to see this black day?” moaned
my father, choking from quick breathing.
“Mine own son, mine Kadish&mdash;mine Kadish
tells me to sell the Holy Book that our forefathers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
shed rivers of blood to hand down to
us.”</p>

<p>“What are you taking it so terrible?” said my
brother. “Doesn’t it stand in the Talmud that
to help marry his daughter a man may sell the
holiest thing&mdash;even the Holy Book?”</p>

<p>“<em>Are there miracles in America?</em> Can she
yet get there a man at her age and without a
dowry?”</p>

<p>“If Hanneh Hayyeh, who is older than Sara
Reisel and not half as good-looking,” said
my brother, “could get a boss from a factory,
then whom cannot Sara Reisel pick out? And
with her luck all of us will be lifted over to
America.”</p>

<p>My father did not answer. I waited, but still
he did not answer.</p>

<p>At last I burst out with all the tears choking
in me for years: “Is your old Saifer Torah that
hangs on the wall dearer to you than that I
should marry? The Talmud tells you to sell the
holiest thing to help marry your daughter, but
you&mdash;you love yourself more than your own
child!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>Then I turned to my mother. I hit my hands
on the table and cried in a voice that made her
tremble and grow frightened: “Maybe you love
your silver candlesticks more than your daughter’s
happiness? To whom can I marry myself
here, I ask you, only&mdash;to the bath janitor, to
the water-carrier? I tell you I’ll kill myself if
you don’t help me get away! I can’t stand no
more this deadness here. I must get away. And
you must give up everything to help me get
away. All I need is a chance. I can do a million
times better than Hanneh Hayyeh. I got a
head. I got brains. I feel I can marry myself
to the greatest man in America.”</p>

<p>My mother stopped crying, took up the candlesticks
from the mantelpiece and passed her
hands over them. “It’s like a piece from my
flesh,” she said. “We grew up with this, you
children and I, and my mother and my mother’s
mother. This and the Saifer Torah are the only
things that shine up the house for the Sabbath.”</p>

<p>She couldn’t go on, her words choked in her
so. I am seeing yet how she looked, holding the
candlesticks in her hands, and her eyes that she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
turned on us. But then I didn’t see anything
but to go to America.</p>

<p>She walked over to my father, who sat with
his head in his hands, stoned with sadness.
“Zalmon!” she sobbed. “The blood from under
my nails I’ll give away, only my child should
have a chance to marry herself well. I’ll give
away my candlesticks&mdash;”</p>

<p>Even my brother Yosef’s eyes filled with tears,
so he quick jumped up and began to whistle and
move around. “You don’t have to sell them,”
he cried, trying to make it light in the air. “You
can pawn them by Moisheh Itzek, the usurer,
and as soon as Sara Reisel will get herself married,
she’ll send us the money to get them out
again, and we’ll yet live to take them over with
us to America.”</p>

<p>I never saw my father look so sad. He looked
like a man from whom the life is bleeding away.
“I’ll not stand myself against your happiness,”
he said, in a still voice. “I only hope this will be
to your luck and that you’ll get married quick,
so we could take out the Saifer Torah from the
pawn.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>In less than a week the Saifer Torah and the
candlesticks were pawned and the ticket bought.
The whole village was ringing with the news
that I am going to America. When I walked in
the street people pointed on me with their fingers
as if I were no more the same Sara Reisel.</p>

<p>Everybody asked me different questions.</p>

<p>“Tell me how it feels to go to America? Can
you yet sleep nights like other people?”</p>

<p>“When you’ll marry yourself in America,
will you yet remember us?”</p>

<p>God from the world! That last Friday night
before I went to America! Maybe it is the last
time we are together was in everybody’s eyes.
Everything that happened seemed so different
from all other times. I felt I was getting ready
to tear my life out from my body.</p>

<p>Without the Saifer Torah the house was dark
and empty. The sun, the sky, the whole heaven
shined from that Holy Book on the wall, and
when it was taken out it left an aching emptiness
on the heart, as if something beautiful
passed out of our lives.</p>

<p>I yet see before me my father in the Rabbi’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
cap, with eyes that look far away into things;
the way he sang the prayer over the wine when
he passed around the glass for every one to give
a sip. The tears rolled out from my little sister’s
eyes down her cheeks and fell into the wine. On
that my mother, who was all the time wiping
her tears, burst out crying. “Shah! Shah!” commanded
my father, rising up from his chair and
beginning to walk around the room. “It’s Sabbath
night, when every Jew should be happy. Is
this the way you give honor to God on His one
day that He set aside for you?”</p>

<p>On the next day, that was Sabbath, father as
if held us up in his hands, and everybody behaved
himself. A stranger coming in couldn’t
see anything that was going on, except that we
walked so still and each one by himself, as if
somebody dying was in the air over us.</p>

<p>On the going-away morning, everybody was
around our house waiting to take me to the station.
Everybody wanted to give a help with
the bundles. The moving along to the station
was like a funeral. Nobody could hold in their
feelings any longer. Everybody fell on my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
neck to kiss me, as if it was my last day on
earth.</p>

<p>“Remember you come from Jews. Remember
to pray every day,” said my father, putting his
hands over my head, like in blessing on the day
of Atonement.</p>

<p>“Only try that we should be together soon
again,” were the last words from my mother as
she wiped her eyes with the corner of her shawl.</p>

<p>“Only don’t forget that I want to study, and
send for me as quick as you marry yourself,”
said Yosef, smiling good-bye with tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p>As I saw the train coming, what wouldn’t I
have given to stay back with the people in Savel
forever! I wanted to cry out: “Take only away
my ticket! I don’t want any more America! I
don’t want any more my lover!”</p>

<p>But as soon as I got into the train, although
my eyes were still looking back to the left-behind
faces, and my ears were yet hearing the good-byes
and the partings, the thoughts of America
began stealing into my heart. I was thinking
how soon I’d have my lover and be rich like
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
Hanneh Hayyeh. And with my luck, everybody
was going to be happy in Savel. The dead people
will stop dying and all the sorrows and troubles
of the world will be wiped away with my happiness.</p>

<p>I didn’t see the day. I didn’t see the night. I
didn’t see the ocean. I didn’t see the sky. I only
saw my lover in America, coming nearer and
nearer to me, till I could feel his eyes bending
on me so near that I got frightened and began
to tremble. My heart ached so with the joy of
his nearness that I quick drew back and turned
away, and began to talk to the people that were
pushing and crowding themselves on the deck.</p>

<p>Nu, I got to America.</p>

<p>Ten hours I pushed a machine in a shirt-waist
factory, when I was yet lucky to get work. And
always my head was drying up with saving and
pinching and worrying to send home a little
from the little I earned. All that my face saw all
day long was girls and machines&mdash;and nothing
else. And even when I came already home from
work, I could only talk to the girls in the working-girls’
boarding-house, or shut myself up in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
my dark, lonesome bedroom. No family, no
friends, nobody to get me acquainted with nobody!
The only men I saw were what passed
me by in the street and in cars.</p>

<p>“Is this ‘lovers’ land’?” was calling in my
heart. “Where are my dreams that were so real
to me in the old country?”</p>

<p>Often in the middle of the work I felt like
stopping all the machines and crying out to
the world the heaviness that pressed on my
heart. Sometimes when I walked in the street I
felt like going over to the first man I met and cry
out to him: “Oh, I’m so lonely! I’m so lonely!”</p>

<p>One day I read in the Jewish “Tageblatt”
the advertisement from Zaretzky, the matchmaker.
“What harm is it if I try my luck?” I
said to myself. “I can’t die away an old maid.
Too much love burns in my heart to stand back
like a stone and only see how other people are
happy. I want to tear myself out from my deadness.
I’m in a living grave. I’ve got to lift myself
up. I have nobody to try for me, and maybe
the matchmaker will help.”</p>

<p>As I walked up Delancey Street to Mr. Zaretzky,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
the street was turning with me. I didn’t
see the crowds. I didn’t see the pushcart peddlers
with their bargains. I didn’t hear the
noises or anything. My eyes were on the sky,
praying: “Gottuniu! Send me only the little bit
of luck!”</p>

<p>“Nu? Nu? What need you?” asked Mr. Zaretzky
when I entered.</p>

<p>I got red with shame in the face the way he
looked at me. I turned up my head. I was too
proud to tell him for what I came. Before I
walked in I thought to tell him everything. But
when I looked on his face and saw his hard eyes,
I couldn’t say a word. I stood like a yok unable
to move my tongue. I went to the matchmaker
with my heart, and I saw before me a stone.
The stone was talking to me&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;he
was a stone!</p>

<p>“Are you looking for a shidduch?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, proud, but crushed.</p>

<p>“You know I charge five dollars for the stepping
in,” he bargained.</p>

<p>It got cold by my heart. It wasn’t only to
give him the five dollars, nearly a whole week’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
wages, but his thick-skinness for being only
after the money. But I couldn’t help myself&mdash;I
was like in his fists hypnotized. And I gave him
the five dollars.</p>

<p>I let myself go to the door, but he called me
back.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait. Come in and sit down. I didn’t
question you yet.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“I got to know how much money you got
saved before I can introduce you to anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h! Is it only depending on the
<em>money</em>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. No move in this world without
money,” he said, taking a pinch of snuff in his
black, hairy fingers and sniffing it up in his nose.</p>

<p>I glanced on his thick neck and greasy, red
face. “And to him people come looking for
love,” I said to myself, shuddering. Oh, how it
burned in my heart, but still I went on, “Can’t
I get a man in America without money?”</p>

<p>He gave a look on me with his sharp eyes.
Gottuniu! What a look! I thought I was sinking
into the floor.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>“There are plenty of <em>young</em> girls with money
that are begging themselves the men to take
them. So what can you expect? <em>Not young, not
lively, and without money, too?</em> But, anyhow, I’ll
see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>He took out a little book from his vest-pocket
and looked through the names.</p>

<p>“What trade do you go on your hands?” he
asked, turning to me. “Sometimes a dressmaker
or a hairdresser that can help make a living for a
man, maybe&mdash;”</p>

<p>I couldn’t hear any more. It got black before
my eyes, my voice stopped inside of me.</p>

<p>“If you want to listen to sense from a friend,
so I have a good match for you,” he said, following
me to the door. “I have on my list a widower
with not more than five or six children. He has a
grand business, a herring-stand on Hester Street.
He don’t ask for no money, and he don’t make
an objection if the girl is in years, so long as she
knows how to cook well for him.”</p>

<p>How I got myself back to my room I don’t
know. But for two days and for two nights I
lay still on my bed, unable to move. I looked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
around on my empty walls, thinking, thinking,
“Where am I? Is this the world? Is this America?”</p>

<p>Suddenly I sprang up from bed. “What can
come from pitying yourself?” I cried. “If the
world kicks you down and makes nothing of
you, you bounce yourself up and make something
of yourself.” A fire blazed up in me to
rise over the world because I was downed by
the world.</p>

<p>“Make a person of yourself,” I said. “Begin
to learn English. Make yourself for an American
if you want to live in America. American
girls don’t go to matchmakers. American girls
don’t run after a man: if they don’t get a husband
they don’t think the world is over; they
turn their mind to something else.</p>

<p>“Wake up!” I said to myself. “You want
love to come to you? Why don’t you give it out
to other people? Love the women and children,
everybody in the street and the shop. Love the
rag-picker and the drunkard, the bad and the
ugly. All those whom the world kicks down you
pick up and press to your heart with love.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>As I said this I felt wells of love that choked
in me all my life flowing out of me and over me.
A strange, wonderful light like a lover’s smile
melted over me, and the sweetness of lover’s
arms stole around me.</p>

<p>The first night I went to school I felt like falling
on everybody’s neck and kissing them. I
felt like kissing the books and the benches. It
was such great happiness to learn to read and
write the English words.</p>

<p>Because I started a few weeks after the beginning
of the term, my teacher said I might stay
after the class to help me catch up with my back
lessons. The minute I looked on him I felt that
grand feeling: “Here is a person! Here is America!”
His face just shined with high thoughts.
There was such a beautiful light in his eyes that
it warmed my heart to steal a look on him.</p>

<p>At first, when it came my turn to say something
in the class, I got so excited the words
stuck and twisted in my mouth and I couldn’t
give out my thoughts. But the teacher didn’t
see my nervousness. He only saw that I had
something to say, and he helped me say it. How
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
or what he did I don’t know. I only felt his look
of understanding flowing into me like draughts
of air to one who is choking.</p>

<p>Long after I already felt free and easy to talk
to him alone after the class, I looked at all the
books on his desk. “Oi weh!” I said to him,
“if I only knew half of what is in your books,
I couldn’t any more sit still in the chair like
you. I’d fly in the air with the joy of so much
knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so eager for learning?” he
asked me.</p>

<p>“Because I want to make a person of myself,”
I answered. “Since I got to work for low
wages and I can’t be young any more, I’m burning
to get among people where it’s not against
a girl if she is in years and without money.”</p>

<p>His hand went out to me. “I’ll help you,” he
said. “But you must first learn to get hold of
yourself.”</p>

<p>Such a beautiful kindness went out of his
heart to me with his words! His voice, and the
goodness that shone from his eyes, made me
want to burst out crying, but I choked back my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
tears till I got home. And all night long I wept
on my pillow: “Fool! What is the matter with
you? Why are you crying?” But I said, “I can’t
help it. He is so beautiful!”</p>

<p>My teacher was so much above me that he
wasn’t a man to me at all. He was a God. His
face lighted up the shop for me, and his voice
sang itself in me everywhere I went. It was
like healing medicine to the flaming fever within
me to listen to his voice. And then I’d repeat to
myself his words and live in them as if they were
religion.</p>

<p>Often as I sat at the machine sewing the
waists I’d forget what I was doing. I’d find myself
dreaming in the air. “Ach!” I asked myself,
“what was that beautifulness in his eyes that
made the lowest nobody feel like a somebody?
What was that about him that when his smile
fell on me I felt lifted up to the sky away from
all the coldness and the ugliness of the world?
Gottunui!” I prayed, “if I could only always
hold on to the light of high thoughts that shined
from him. If I could only always hear in my
heart the sound of his voice I would need
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
nothing more in life. I would be happier than
a bird in the air.</p>

<p>“Friend,” I said to him once, “if you could
but teach me how to get cold in the heart and
clear in the head like you are!”</p>

<p>He only smiled at me and looked far away.
His calmness was like the sureness of money
in the bank. Then he turned and looked on me,
and said: “I am not so cold in the heart and
clear in the head as I make-believe. I am bound.
I am a prisoner of convention.”</p>

<p>“You make-believe&mdash;you bound?” I burst
out. “You who do not have foreladies or bosses&mdash;you
who do not have to sell yourself for wages&mdash;you
who only work for love and truth&mdash;you
a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“True, I do not have bosses just as you do,”
he said. “But still I am not free. I am bound by
formal education and conventional traditions.
Though you work in a shop, you are really freer
than I. You are not repressed as I am by the
fear and shame of feeling. You could teach me
more than I could teach you. You could teach
me how to be natural.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>“I’m not so natural like you think,” I said.
“I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>He smiled at me out of his eyes. “What are
you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of my heart,” I said, trying to
hold back the blood rushing to my face. “I’m
burning to get calm and sensible like the born
Americans. But how can I help it? My heart
flies away from me like a wild bird. How can I
learn to keep myself down on earth like the born
Americans?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to get down on earth
like the Americans. That is just the beauty and
the wonder of you. We Americans are too much
on earth; we need more of your power to fly. If
you would only know how much you can teach
us Americans. You are the promise of the centuries
to come. You are the heart, the creative
pulse of America to be.”</p>

<p>I walked home on wings. My teacher said that
I could help him; that I had something to give
to Americans. “But how could I teach him?”
I wondered; “I who had never had a chance to
learn anything except what he taught me. And
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
what had I to give to the Americans, I who am
nothing but dreams and longings and hunger for
love?”</p>

<p>When school closed down for vacation, it
seemed to me all life stopped in the world. I had
no more class to look forward to, no more chance
of seeing my teacher. As I faced the emptiness
of my long vacation, all the light went out of my
eyes, and all the strength out of my arms and
fingers.</p>

<p>For nearly a week I was like without air.
There was no school. One night I came home
from the shop and threw myself down on the
bed. I wanted to cry, to let out the heavy weight
that pressed on my heart, but I couldn’t cry.
My tears felt like hot, burning sand in my
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! I can’t stand it no more, this emptiness,”
I groaned. “Why don’t I kill myself?
Why don’t something happen to me? No consumption,
no fever, no plague or death ever
comes to save me from this terrible world. I
have to go on suffering and choking inside myself
till I grow mad.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>I jumped up from the bed, threw open the
window, and began fighting with the deaf-and-dumb
air in the air-shaft.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” I cried. “You
are going out of your head. You are sinking
back into the old ways from which you dragged
yourself out with your studies. Studies! What
did I get from all my studies? Nothing. Nothing.
I am still in the same shop with the same shirt-waists.
A lot my teacher cares for me once the
class is over.”</p>

<p>A fire burned up in me that he was already
forgetting me. And I shot out a letter to him:</p>

<p>“You call yourself a teacher? A friend? How
can you go off in the country and drop me out
of your heart and out of your head like a read-over
book you left on the shelf of your shut-down
classroom? How can you enjoy your vacation
in the country while I’m in the sweatshop? You
learned me nothing. You only broke my heart.
What good are all the books you ever gave me?
They don’t tell me how to be happy in a factory.
They don’t tell me how to keep alive in emptiness,
or how to find something beautiful in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
dirt and ugliness in which I got to waste away.
I want life. I want people. I can’t live inside
my head as you do.”</p>

<p>I sent the letter off in the madness in which
I wrote it, without stopping to think; but the
minute after I dropped it in the mail-box my
reason came again to my head. I went back
tearing my hair. “What have I done? Meshugeneh!”</p>

<p>Walking up the stairs I saw my door open. I
went in. The sky is falling to the earth! Am I
dreaming? There was my teacher sitting on my
trunk! My teacher come to see me? Me, in
my dingy room? For a minute it got blind before
my eyes, and I didn’t know where I was any
more.</p>

<p>“I had to come,” he said, the light of heaven
shining on me out of his eyes. “I was so desolate
without you. I tried to say something to you
before I left for my vacation, but the words
wouldn’t come. Since I have been away I have
written you many letters, but I did not mail
them, for they were like my old self from which
I want to break away.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>He put his cool, strong hand into mine. “You
can save me,” he said. “You can free me from
the bondage of age-long repressions. You can
lift me out of the dead grooves of sterile intellectuality.
Without you I am the dry dust of
hopes unrealized. You are fire and sunshine
and desire. You make life changeable and beautiful
and full of daily wonder.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t speak. I was so on fire with his
words. Then, like whirlwinds in my brain,
rushed out the burning words of the matchmaker:
“Not young, not lively, and without
money, too!”</p>

<p>“You are younger than youth,” he said, kissing
my hands. “Every day of your unlived
youth shall be relived with love, but such a love
as youth could never know.”</p>

<p>And then how it happened I don’t know; but
his arms were around me. “Sara Reisel, tell me,
do you love me,” he said, kissing me on my hair
and on my eyes and on my lips.</p>

<p>I could only weep and tremble with joy at
his touch. “The miracle!” cried my heart; “the
miracle of America come true!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>WHERE LOVERS DREAM</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">For</span> years I was saying to myself&mdash;Just so you
will act when you meet him. Just so you will
stand. So will you look on him. These words you
will say to him.</p>

<p>I wanted to show him that what he had done
to me could not down me; that his leaving me
the way he left me, that his breaking my heart
the way he broke it, didn’t crush me; that his
grand life and my pinched-in life, his having
learning and my not having learning&mdash;that
the difference didn’t count so much like it
seemed; that on the bottom I was the same like
him.</p>

<p>But he came upon me so sudden, all my plannings
for years smashed to the wall. The sight
of him was like an earthquake shaking me to
pieces.</p>

<p>I can’t yet see nothing in front of me and
can’t get my head together to anything, so
torn up I am from the shock.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>It was at Yetta Solomon’s wedding I met him
again. She was after me for weeks I should only
come.</p>

<p>“How can I come to such a swell hall?” I
told her. “You know I ain’t got nothing decent
to wear.”</p>

<p>“Like you are without no dressing-up, I
want you to come. You are the kind what people
look in your eyes and not on what you got
on. Ain’t you yourself the one what helped me
with my love troubles? And now, when everything
is turning out happy, you mean to tell me
that you ain’t going to be there?”</p>

<p>She gave me a grab over and kissed me in a
way that I couldn’t say “No” to her.</p>

<p>So I shined myself up in the best I had and
went to the wedding.</p>

<p>I was in the middle from giving my congratulations
to Yetta and her new husband, when&mdash;Gott!
Gott im Himmel! The sky is falling to
the earth! I see him&mdash;him, and his wife leaning
on his arm, coming over.</p>

<p>I gave a fall back, like something sharp hit
me. My head got dizzy, and my eyes got blind.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>I wanted to run away from him, but, ach!
everything in me rushed to him.</p>

<p>I was feeling like struck deaf, dumb, and
blind all in one.</p>

<p>He must have said something to me, and I
must have answered back something to him,
but how? What? I only remember like in a
dream my getting to the cloakroom. Such a tearing,
grinding pain was dragging me down to the
floor that I had to hold on to the wall not to fall.</p>

<p>All of a sudden I feel a pull on my arm. It was
the janitor with the broom in his hand.</p>

<p>“Lady, are you sick? The wedding people is
all gone, and I swept up already.”</p>

<p>But I couldn’t wake up from myself.</p>

<p>“Lady, the lights is going out,” he says,
looking on me queer.</p>

<p>“I think I ain’t well,” I said. And I went out.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ach, I see again the time when we was lovers!
How beautiful the world was then!</p>

<p>“Maybe there never was such love like ours,
and never will be,” we was always telling one
another.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>When we was together there was like a light
shining around us, the light from his heart on
mine, and from my heart on his. People began
to look happy just looking on us.</p>

<p>When we was walking we didn’t feel we was
touching the earth but flying high up through
the air. We looked on the rest of the people with
pity, because it was seeming to us that we was
the only two persons awake, and all the rest was
hurrying and pushing and slaving and crowding
one on the other without the splendidness of
feeling for what it was all for, like we was feeling
it.</p>

<p>David was learning for a doctor. Daytimes he
went to college, and nights he was in a drug-store.
I was working in a factory on shirt-waists.
We was poor. But we didn’t feel poor. The
waists I was sewing flyed like white birds
through my fingers, because his face was shining
out of everything I touched.</p>

<p>David was always trying to learn me how to
make myself over for an American. Sometimes
he would spend out fifteen cents to buy me the
“Ladies’ Home Journal” to read about American
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
life, and my whole head was put away on
how to look neat and be up-to-date like the
American girls. Till long hours in the night I
used to stay up brushing and pressing my plain
blue suit with the white collar what David
liked, and washing my waists, and fixing up my
hat like the pattern magazines show you.</p>

<p>On holidays he took me out for a dinner by a
restaurant, to learn me how the Americans eat,
with napkins, and use up so many plates&mdash;the
butter by itself, and the bread by itself, and the
meat by itself, and the potatoes by itself.</p>

<p>Always when the six o’clock whistle blowed,
he was waiting for me on the corner from the
shop to take me home.</p>

<p>“Ut, there waits Sara’s doctor feller,” the
girls were nudging one to the other, as we went
out from the shop. “Ain’t she the lucky one!”</p>

<p>All the way as we walked along he was learning
me how to throw off my greenhorn talk, and
say out the words in the American.</p>

<p>He used to stop me in the middle of the pavement
and laugh from me, shaking me: “No
t’ink or t’ank or t’ought, now. You’re an American,”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
he would say to me. And then he would
fix my tongue and teeth together and make me
say after him: “th-think, th-thank, th-thought;
this, that, there.” And if I said the words right,
he kissed me in the hall when we got home. And
if I said them wrong, he kissed me anyhow.</p>

<p>He moved next door to us, so we shouldn’t
lose the sweetness from one little minute that
we could be together. There was only the thin
wall between our kitchen and his room, and
the first thing in the morning, we would knock
in one to the other to begin the day together.</p>

<p>“See what I got for you, Hertzele,” he said
to me one day, holding up a grand printed card.</p>

<p>I gave a read. It was the ticket invitation for
his graduation from college. I gave it a touch,
with pride melting over in my heart.</p>

<p>“Only one week more, and you’ll be a doctor
for the world!”</p>

<p>“And then, heart of mine,” he said, drawing
me over to him and kissing me on the lips,
“when I get my office fixed up, you will marry
me?”</p>

<p>“Ach, such a happiness,” I answered, “to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
together all the time, and wait on you and cook
for you, and do everything for you, like if I was
your mother!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Rosenberg is coming special from
Boston for my graduation.”</p>

<p>“The one what helped out your chance for
college?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s going to start me up the doctor’s
office, he says. Like his son he looks on me,
because he only got daughters in his family.”</p>

<p>“Ach, the good heart! He’ll yet have joy and
good luck from us! What is he saying about
me?” I ask.</p>

<p>“I want him to see you first, darling. You
can’t help going to his heart, when he’ll only
give a look on you.”</p>

<p>“Think only, Mammele&mdash;David is graduating
for a doctor in a week!” I gave a hurry
in to my mother that night. “And his Uncle
Rosenberg is coming special from Boston and
says he’ll start him up in his doctor’s office.”</p>

<p>“Oi weh, the uncle is going to give a come,
you say? Look how the house looks! And the
children in rags and no shoes on their feet!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>The whole week before the uncle came, my
mother and I was busy nights buying and fixing
up, and painting the chairs, and nailing together
solid the table, and hanging up calendar
pictures to cover up the broken plaster on the
wall, and fixing the springs from the sleeping
lounge so it didn’t sink in, and scrubbing up
everything, and even washing the windows, like
before Passover.</p>

<p>I stopped away from the shop, on the day
David was graduating. Everything in the house
was like for a holiday. The children shined up
like rich people’s children, with their faces
washed clean and their hair brushed and new
shoes on their feet. I made my father put away
his black shirt and dress up in an American
white shirt and starched collar. I fixed out my
mother in a new white waist and a blue checked
apron, and I blowed myself to dress up the
baby in everything new, like a doll in a window.
Her round, laughing face lighted up the house,
so beautiful she was.</p>

<p>By the time we got finished the rush to fix
ourselves out, the children’s cheeks was red
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
with excitement and our eyes was bulging
bright, like ready to start for a picnic.</p>

<p>When David came in with his uncle, my
father and mother and all the children gave a
stand up.</p>

<p>But the “Boruch Chabo” and the hot words
of welcome, what was rushing from us to say,
froze up on our lips by the stiff look the uncle
throwed on us.</p>

<p>David’s uncle didn’t look like David. He had
a thick neck and a red face and the breathing of
a man what eats plenty.&mdash;But his eyes looked
smart like David’s.</p>

<p>He wouldn’t take no seat and didn’t seem
to want to let go from the door.</p>

<p>David laughed and talked fast, and moved
around nervous, trying to cover up the ice.
But he didn’t get no answers from nobody.
And he didn’t look in my eyes, and I was
feeling myself ashamed, like I did something
wrong which I didn’t understand.</p>

<p>My father started up to say something to the
uncle&mdash;“Our David&mdash;” But I quick pulled
him by the sleeve to stop. And nobody after
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
that could say nothing, nobody except David.</p>

<p>I couldn’t get up the heart to ask them to
give a taste from the cake and the wine what
we made ready special for them on the table.</p>

<p>The baby started crying for a cake, and I
quick went over to take her up, because I
wanted to hide myself with being busy with her.
But only the crying and nothing else happening
made my heart give a shiver, like bad luck
was in the air.</p>

<p>And right away the uncle and him said good-bye
and walked out.</p>

<p>When the door was shut the children gave
a rush for the cakes, and then burst out in the
street.</p>

<p>“Come, Schmuel,” said my mother, “I got
to say something with you.” And she gave my
father a pull in the other room and closed the
door.</p>

<p>I felt they was trying not to look on me, and
was shrinking away from the shame that was
throwed on me.</p>

<p>“Och, what’s the matter with me! Nothing
can come between David and me. His uncle
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
ain’t everything,” I said, trying to pull up my
head.</p>

<p>I sat myself down by the table to cool down
my nervousness. “Brace yourself up,” I said
to myself, jumping up from the chair and beginning
to walk around again. “Nothing has
happened. Stop off nagging yourself.”</p>

<p>Just then I hear loud voices through the
wall. I go nearer. Ut, it’s his uncle!</p>

<p>The plaster from the wall was broken on our
side by the door. “Lay your ear in this crack,
and you can hear plain the words,” I say to myself.</p>

<p>“What’s getting over you? You ain’t that
kind to do such a thing,” I say. But still I do it.</p>

<p>Oi weh, I hear the uncle plainly! “What’s
all this mean, these neighbors? Who’s the
pretty girl what made such eyes on you?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t she beautiful? Do you like her?” I
hear David.</p>

<p>“What? What’s that matter to you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll marry myself to her,” says David.</p>

<p>“Marry! Marry yourself into that beggar
house! Are you crazy?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>“A man could get to anywhere with such a
beautiful girl.”</p>

<p>“Koosh! Pretty faces is cheap like dirt. What
has she got to bring you in for your future? An
empty pocketbook? A starving family to hang
over your neck?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know nothing about her. You
don’t know what you’re saying. She comes
from fine people in Russia. You can see her
father is a learned man.”</p>

<p>“Ach! You make me a disgust with your calf
talk! Poverty winking from every corner of
the house! Hunger hollering from all their
starved faces! I got too much sense to waste my
love on beggars. And all the time I was planning
for you an American family, people which are
somebodies in this world, which could help you
work up a practice! For why did I waste my
good dollars on you?”</p>

<p>“Gott! Ain’t David answering?” my heart
cries out. “Why don’t he throw him out of the
house?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can’t hear him,” I think, and with
my finger-nails I pick thinner the broken plaster.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>I push myself back to get away and not to do
it. But it did itself with my hands. “Don’t let
me hear nothing,” I pray, and yet I strain more
to hear.</p>

<p>The uncle was still hollering. And David
wasn’t saying nothing for me.</p>

<p>“Gazlen! You want to sink your life in a
family of beggars?”</p>

<p>“But I love her. We’re so happy together.
Don’t that count for something? I can’t live
without her.”</p>

<p>“Koosh! Love her! Do you want to plan your
future with your heart or with your head? Take
for your wife an ignorant shopgirl without a
cent! Can two dead people start up a dance
together?”</p>

<p>“So you mean not to help me with the office?”</p>

<p>“Yah-yah-yah! I’ll run on all fours to do it!
The impudence from such penniless nobodies
wanting to pull in a young man with a future
for a doctor! Nobody but such a yok like you
would be such an easy mark.”</p>

<p>“Well, I got to live my own life, and I love
her.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>“That’s all I got to say.&mdash;Where’s my hat?
Throw yourself away on the pretty face, make
yourself to shame and to laughter with a ragged
Melamid for a father-in-law, and I wash my
hands from you for the rest of your life.”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>A change came over David from that day.
For the first time we was no more one person
together. We couldn’t no more laugh and talk
like we used to. When I tried to look him in the
eyes, he gave them a turn away from me.</p>

<p>I used to lie awake nights turning over in my
head David’s looks, David’s words, and it made
me frightened like something black rising over
me and pushing me out from David’s heart. I
could feel he was blaming me for something I
couldn’t understand.</p>

<p>Once David asked me, “Don’t you love me
no more?”</p>

<p>I tried to tell him that there wasn’t no change
in my love, but I couldn’t no more talk out to
him what was in my mind, like I used.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to worry you before with my
worries,” he said to me at last.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>“Worry me, David! What am I here for?”</p>

<p>“My uncle is acting like a stingy grouch,” he
answered me, “and I can’t stand no more his
bossing me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you speak yourself out to me
what was on your mind, David?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how my plans is smashed
to pieces,” he said, with a worried look on his
face. “I don’t see how I’ll ever be able to open
my doctor’s office. And how can we get married
with your people hanging on for your wages?”</p>

<p>“Ah, David, don’t you no longer feel that
love can find a way out?”</p>

<p>He looked on me, down and up, and up and
down, till I drawed myself back, frightened.</p>

<p>But he grabbed me back to him. “I love you.
I love you, heart of mine,” he said, kissing me
on the neck, on my hair and my eyes. “And
nothing else matters, does it, does it?” and he
kissed me again and again, as if he wanted to
swallow me up.</p>

<p>Next day I go out from the shop and down
the steps to meet him, like on every day.</p>

<p>I give a look around.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>“Gott! Where is he? He wasn’t never late
before,” gave a knock my heart.</p>

<p>I waited out till all the girls was gone, and
the streets was getting empty, but David didn’t
come yet.</p>

<p>“Maybe an accident happened to him, and I
standing round here like a dummy,” and I gave
a quick hurry home.</p>

<p>But nobody had heard nothing.</p>

<p>“He’s coming! He <em>must</em> come!” I fighted
back my fear. But by evening he hadn’t come
yet.</p>

<p>I sent in my brother next door to see if he
could find him.</p>

<p>“He moved to-day,” comes in my brother to
tell me.</p>

<p>“My God! David left me? It ain’t possible!”</p>

<p>I walk around the house, waiting and listening.
“Don’t let nobody see your nervousness.
Don’t let yourself out. Don’t break down.”</p>

<p>It got late and everybody was gone to bed.</p>

<p>I couldn’t take my clothes off. Any minute
he’ll come up the steps or knock on the wall.
Any minute a telegram will come.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>It’s twelve o’clock. It’s one. Two!</p>

<p>Every time I hear footsteps in the empty
street, I am by the window&mdash;“Maybe it’s him.”</p>

<p>It’s beginning the day.</p>

<p>The sun is rising. Oi weh, how can the sun
rise and he not here?</p>

<p>Mein Gott! He ain’t coming!</p>

<p>I sit myself down on the floor by the window
with my head on the sill.</p>

<p>Everybody is sleeping. I can’t sleep. And I’m
so tired.</p>

<p>Next day I go, like pushed on, to the shop,
glad to be swallowed up by my work.</p>

<p>The noise of the knocking machines is like a
sleeping-medicine to the cryings inside of me.
All day I watched my hands push the waists up
and down the machine. I wasn’t with my hands.
It was like my breathing stopped and I was
sitting inside of myself, waiting for David.</p>

<p>The six o’clock whistle blowed. I go out
from the shop.</p>

<p>I can’t help it&mdash;I look for him.</p>

<p>“Oi, Gott! Do something for me once! Send
him only!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>I hold on to the iron fence of the shop, because
I feel my heart bleeding away.</p>

<p>I can’t go away. The girls all come out from
the shops, and the streets get empty and still.
But at the end of the block once in a while
somebody crosses and goes out from sight.</p>

<p>I watch them. I begin counting, “One, two,
three&mdash;”</p>

<p>Underneath my mind is saying, “Maybe it’s
him. Maybe the next one!”</p>

<p>My eyes shut themselves. I feel the end from
everything.</p>

<p>“Ah, David! David! Gott! Mein Gott!”</p>

<p>I fall on the steps and clinch the stones with
the twistings of my body. A terrible cry breaks
out from me&mdash;“David! David!” My soul is
tearing itself out from my body. It is gone.</p>

<p>Next day I got news&mdash;David opened a
doctor’s office uptown.</p>

<p>Nothing could hurt me no more. I didn’t
hope for nothing. Even if he wanted me back, I
couldn’t go to him no more. I was like something
dying what wants to be left alone in darkness.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>But still something inside of me wanted to
see for itself how all is dead between us, and I
write him:</p>

<p>“David Novak: You killed me. You killed
my love. Why did you leave me yet living?
Why must I yet drag on the deadness from
me?”</p>

<p>I don’t know why I wrote him. I just wanted
to give a look on him. I wanted to fill up my
eyes with him before I turned them away forever.</p>

<p>I was sitting by the table in the kitchen,
wanting to sew, but my hands was lying dead
on the table, when the door back of me burst
open.</p>

<p>“O God! What have I done? Your face is
like ashes! You look like you are dying!” David
gave a rush in.</p>

<p>His hair wasn’t combed, his face wasn’t
shaved, his clothes was all wrinkled. My letter
he was holding crushed in his hand.</p>

<p>“I killed you! I left you! But I didn’t rest a
minute since I went away! Heart of mine, forgive
me!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>He gave a take my hand, and fell down kneeling
by me.</p>

<p>“Sarale, speak to me!”</p>

<p>“False dog! Coward!” cried my father,
breaking in on us. “Get up! Get out! Don’t
dare touch my child again! May your name and
memory be blotted out!”</p>

<p>David covered up his head with his arm and
fell back to the wall like my father had hit him.</p>

<p>“You yet listen to him?” cried my father,
grabbing me by the arm and shaking me.
“Didn’t I tell you he’s a Meshumid, a denier
of God?”</p>

<p>“Have pity! Speak to me! Give me only a
word!” David begged me.</p>

<p>I wanted to speak to him, to stretch out my
hands to him and call him over, but I couldn’t
move my body. No voice came from my lips
no more than if I was locked in my grave.</p>

<p>I was dead, and the David I loved was dead.</p>

<p>I married Sam because he came along and
wanted me, and I didn’t care about nothing
no more.</p>

<p>But for long after, even when the children
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>
began coming, my head was still far away in
the dream of the time when love was. Before
my eyes was always his face, drawing me on.
In my ears was always his voice, but thin, like
from far away.</p>

<p>I was like a person following after something
in the dark.</p>

<p>For years when I went out into the street
or got into a car, it gave a knock my heart&mdash;“Maybe
I’ll see him yet to-day.”</p>

<p>When I heard he got himself engaged, I
hunted up where she lived, and with Sammy in
the carriage and the three other children hanging
on to my skirts, I stayed around for hours
to look up at the grand stone house where she
lived, just to take a minute’s look on her.</p>

<p>When I seen her go by, it stabbed awake in
me the old days.</p>

<p>It ain’t that I still love him, but nothing
don’t seem real to me no more. For the little
while when we was lovers I breathed the air
from the high places where love comes from,
and I can’t no more come down.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>SOAP AND WATER</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">What</span> I so greatly feared, happened! Miss
Whiteside, the dean of our college, withheld my
diploma. When I came to her office, and asked
her why she did not pass me, she said that she
could not recommend me as a teacher because
of my personal appearance.</p>

<p>She told me that my skin looked oily, my hair
unkempt, and my finger-nails sadly neglected.
She told me that I was utterly unmindful of the
little niceties of the well-groomed lady. She
pointed out that my collar did not set evenly,
my belt was awry, and there was a lack of freshness
in my dress. And she ended with: “Soap
and water are cheap. Any one can be clean.”</p>

<p>In those four years while I was under her
supervision, I was always timid and diffident. I
shrank and trembled when I had to come near
her. When I had to say something to her, I
mumbled and stuttered, and grew red and white
in the face with fear.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>Every time I had to come to the dean’s office
for a private conference, I prepared for the ordeal
of her cold scrutiny, as a patient prepares
for a surgical operation. I watched her gimlet
eyes searching for a stray pin, for a spot on my
dress, for my unpolished shoes, for my uncared-for
finger-nails, as one strapped on the operating
table watches the surgeon approaching with his
tray of sterilized knives.</p>

<p>She never looked into my eyes. She never
perceived that I had a soul. She did not see
how I longed for beauty and cleanliness. How
I strained and struggled to lift myself from
the dead toil and exhaustion that weighed me
down. She could see nothing in people like me,
except the dirt and the stains on the outside.</p>

<p>But this last time when she threatened to
withhold my diploma, because of my appearance,
this last time when she reminded me that
“Soap and water are cheap. Any one can be
clean,” this last time, something burst within
me.</p>

<p>I felt the suppressed wrath of all the unwashed
of the earth break loose within me. My
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
eyes blazed fire. I didn’t care for myself, nor the
dean, nor the whole laundered world. I had suffered
the cruelty of their cleanliness and the
tyranny of their culture to the breaking point. I
was too frenzied to know what I said or did.
But I saw clean, immaculate, spotless Miss
Whiteside shrivel and tremble and cower before
me, as I had shriveled and trembled and
cowered before her for so many years.</p>

<p>Why did she give me my diploma? Was it
pity? Or can it be that in my outburst of fury,
at the climax of indignities that I had suffered,
the barriers broke, and she saw into the world
below from where I came?</p>

<p>Miss Whiteside had no particular reason for
hounding and persecuting me. Personally, she
didn’t give a hang if I was clean or dirty. She
was merely one of the agents of clean society,
delegated to judge who is fit and who is unfit to
teach.</p>

<p>While they condemned me as unfit to be a
teacher, because of my appearance, I was slaving
to keep them clean. I was slaving in a laundry
from five to eight in the morning, before going
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
to college, and from six to eleven at night,
after coming from college. Eight hours of work a
day, outside my studies. Where was the time
and the strength for the “little niceties of the
well-groomed lady”?</p>

<p>At the time when they rose and took their
morning bath, and put on their fresh-laundered
linen that somebody had made ready for them,
when they were being served with their breakfast,
I had already toiled for three hours in a
laundry.</p>

<p>When college hours were over, they went for
a walk in the fresh air. They had time to rest,
and bathe again, and put on fresh clothes for
dinner. But I, after college hours, had only time
to bolt a soggy meal, and rush back to the grind
of the laundry till eleven at night.</p>

<p>At the hour when they came from the theater
or musicale, I came from the laundry. But I was
so bathed in the sweat of exhaustion that I could
not think of a bath of soap and water. I had only
strength to drag myself home, and fall down on
the bed and sleep. Even if I had had the desire
and the energy to take a bath, there were no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
such things as bathtubs in the house where I
lived.</p>

<p>Often as I stood at my board at the laundry, I
thought of Miss Whiteside, and her clean world,
clothed in the snowy shirt-waists I had ironed.
I was thinking&mdash;I, soaking in the foul vapors
of the steaming laundry, I, with my dirty, tired
hands, I am ironing the clean, immaculate shirt-waists
of clean, immaculate society. I, the unclean
one, am actually fashioning the pedestal of
their cleanliness, from which they reach down,
hoping to lift me to the height that I have created
for them.</p>

<p>I look back at my sweatshop childhood. One
day, when I was about sixteen, some one gave
me Rosenfeld’s poem, “The Machine,” to read.
Like a spark thrown among oily rags, it set my
whole being aflame with longing for self-expression.
But I was dumb. I had nothing but blind,
aching feeling. For days I went about with
agonies of feeling, yet utterly at sea how to
fathom and voice those feelings&mdash;birth-throes
of infinite worlds, and yet dumb.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there came upon me this inspiration.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>
I can go to college! There I shall learn to
express myself, to voice my thoughts. But I was
not prepared to go to college. The girl in the
cigar factory, in the next block, had gone first
to a preparatory school. Why shouldn’t I find
a way, too?</p>

<p>Going to college seemed as impossible for me,
at that time, as for an ignorant Russian shopgirl
to attempt to write poetry in English. But
I was sixteen then, and the impossible was a
magnet to draw the dreams that had no outlet.
Besides, the actual was so barren, so narrow, so
strangling, that the dream of the unattainable
was the only air in which the soul could survive.</p>

<p>The ideal of going to college was like the
birth of a new religion in my soul. It put new
fire in my eyes, and new strength in my tired
arms and fingers.</p>

<p>For six years I worked daytimes and went
at night to a preparatory school. For six years
I went about nursing the illusion that college
was a place where I should find self-expression,
and vague, pent-up feelings could live as
thoughts and grow as ideas.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>At last I came to college. I rushed for it with
the outstretched arms of youth’s aching hunger
to give and take of life’s deepest and highest,
and I came against the solid wall of the well-fed,
well-dressed world&mdash;the frigid whitewashed
wall of cleanliness.</p>

<p>Until I came to college I had been unconscious
of my clothes. Suddenly I felt people
looking at me at arm’s length, as if I were
crooked or crippled, as if I had come to a place
where I didn’t belong, and would never be
taken in.</p>

<p>How I pinched, and scraped, and starved myself,
to save enough to come to college! Every
cent of the tuition fee I paid was drops of sweat
and blood from underpaid laundry work. And
what did I get for it? A crushed spirit, a broken
heart, a stinging sense of poverty that I never
felt before.</p>

<p>The courses of study I had to swallow to get
my diploma were utterly barren of interest to
me. I didn’t come to college to get dull learning
from dead books. I didn’t come for that dry,
inanimate stuff that can be hammered out in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>
lectures. I came because I longed for the larger
life, for the stimulus of intellectual associations.
I came because my whole being clamored
for more vision, more light. But everywhere
I went I saw big fences put up against me, with
the brutal signs: “No trespassing. Get off the
grass.”</p>

<p>I experienced at college the same feeling of
years ago when I came to this country, when
after months of shut-in-ness, in dark tenements
and stifling sweatshops, I had come to Central
Park for the first time. Like a bird just out from
a cage, I stretched out my arms, and then flung
myself in ecstatic abandon on the grass. Just
as I began to breathe in the fresh-smelling
earth, and lift up my eyes to the sky, a big, fat
policeman with a club in his hand, seized me,
with: “Can’t you read the sign? Get off the
grass!” Miss Whiteside, the dean of the college,
the representative of the clean, the educated
world, for all her external refinement, was to me
like that big, brutal policeman, with the club
in his hand, that drove me off the grass.</p>

<p>The death-blows to all aspiration began when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
I graduated from college and tried to get a
start at the work for which I had struggled so
hard to fit myself. I soon found other agents
of clean society, who had the power of giving or
withholding the positions I sought, judging me
as Miss Whiteside judged me. One glance at
my shabby clothes, the desperate anguish that
glazed and dulled my eyes and I felt myself
condemned by them before I opened my lips
to speak.</p>

<p>Starvation forced me to accept the lowest-paid
substitute position. And because my wages
were so low and so unsteady, I could never get
the money for the clothes to make an appearance
to secure a position with better pay. I was
tricked and foiled. I was considered unfit to get
decent pay for my work because of my appearance,
and it was to the advantage of those who
used me that my appearance should damn me,
so as to get me to work for the low wages I was
forced to accept. It seemed to me the whole
vicious circle of society’s injustices was thrust
like a noose around my neck to strangle me.</p>

<p>The insults and injuries I had suffered at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
college had so eaten into my flesh that I could
not bear to get near it. I shuddered with horror
whenever I had to pass the place blocks away.
The hate which I felt for Miss Whiteside spread
like poison inside my soul, into hate for all
clean society. The whole clean world was
massed against me. Whenever I met a well-dressed
person, I felt the secret stab of a hidden
enemy.</p>

<p>I was so obsessed and consumed with my
grievances that I could not get away from myself
and think things out in the light. I was in
the grip of that blinding, destructive, terrible
thing&mdash;righteous indignation. I could not rest.
I wanted the whole world to know that the college
was against democracy in education, that
clothes form the basis of class distinctions, that
after graduation the opportunities for the best
positions are passed out to those who are best-dressed,
and the students too poor to put up a
front are pigeon-holed and marked unfit and
abandoned to the mercy of the wind.</p>

<p>A wild desire raged in the corner of my brain.
I knew that the dean gave dinners to the faculty
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
at regular intervals. I longed to burst in at
one of those feasts, in the midst of their grand
speech-making, and tear down the fine clothes
from these well-groomed ladies and gentlemen,
and trample them under my feet, and scream
like a lunatic: “Soap and water are cheap! Soap
and water are cheap! Look at me! See how cheap
it is!”</p>

<p>There seemed but three avenues of escape to
the torments of my wasted life, madness, suicide,
or a heart-to-heart confession to some one
who understood. I had not energy enough for
suicide. Besides, in my darkest moments of
despair, hope clamored loudest. Oh, I longed so
to live, to dream my way up on the heights,
above the unreal realities that ground me and
dragged me down to earth.</p>

<p>Inside the ruin of my thwarted life, the <em>unlived</em>
visionary immigrant hungered and thirsted
for America. I had come a refugee from the
Russian pogroms, aflame with dreams of
America. I did not find America in the sweatshops,
much less in the schools and colleges.
But for hundreds of years the persecuted races
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
all over the world were nurtured on hopes of
America. When a little baby in my mother’s
arms, before I was old enough to speak, I saw
all around me weary faces light up with thrilling
tales of the far-off “golden country.” And so,
though my faith in this so-called America was
shattered, yet underneath, in the sap and roots
of my soul, burned the deathless faith that
America is, must be, somehow, somewhere. In
the midst of my bitterest hates and rebellions,
visions of America rose over me, like songs of
freedom of an oppressed people.</p>

<p>My body was worn to the bone from overwork,
my footsteps dragged with exhaustion,
but my eyes still sought the sky, praying, ceaselessly
praying, the dumb, inarticulate prayer of
the lost immigrant: “America! Ach, America!
Where is America?”</p>

<p>It seemed to me if I could only find some human
being to whom I could unburden my heart,
I would have new strength to begin again my
insatiable search for America.</p>

<p>But to whom could I speak? The people in
the laundry? They never understood me. They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
had a grudge against me because I left them
when I tried to work myself up. Could I speak
to the college people? What did these icebergs
of convention know about the vital things of
the heart?</p>

<p>And yet, I remembered, in the freshman year,
in one of the courses in chemistry, there was an
instructor, a woman, who drew me strangely. I
felt she was the only real teacher among all the
teachers and professors I met. I didn’t care for
the chemistry, but I liked to look at her. She
gave me life, air, the unconscious emanation
of her beautiful spirit. I had not spoken a word
to her, outside the experiments in chemistry,
but I knew her more than the people around
her who were of her own class. I felt in the throb
of her voice, in the subtle shading around the
corner of her eyes, the color and texture of her
dreams.</p>

<p>Often in the midst of our work in chemistry
I felt like crying out to her: “Oh, please be my
friend. I’m so lonely.” But something choked
me. I couldn’t speak. The very intensity of my
longing for her friendship made me run away
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
from her in confusion the minute she approached
me. I was so conscious of my shabbiness
that I was afraid maybe she was only
trying to be kind. I couldn’t bear kindness.
I wanted from her love, understanding, or
nothing.</p>

<p>About ten years after I left college, as I
walked the streets bowed and beaten with the
shame of having to go around begging for work,
I met Miss Van Ness. She not only recognized
me, but stopped to ask how I was, and what I
was doing.</p>

<p>I had begun to think that my only comrades
in this world were the homeless and abandoned
cats and dogs of the street, whom everybody
gives another kick, as they slam the door on
them. And here was one from the clean world
human enough to be friendly. Here was one of
the well-dressed, with a look in her eyes and a
sound in her voice that was like healing oil over
the bruises of my soul. The mere touch of that
woman’s hand in mine so overwhelmed me,
that I burst out crying in the street.</p>

<p>The next morning I came to Miss Van Ness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
at her office. In those ten years she had risen to
a professorship. But I was not in the least intimidated
by her high office. I felt as natural in
her presence as if she were my own sister. I
heard myself telling her the whole story of my
life, but I felt that even if I had not said a word
she would have understood all I had to say as
if I had spoken. It was all so unutterable, to
find one from the other side of the world who
was so simply and naturally that miraculous
thing&mdash;a friend. Just as contact with Miss
Whiteside had tied and bound all my thinking
processes, so Miss Van Ness unbound and freed
me and suffused me with light.</p>

<p>I felt the joy of one breathing on the mountain-tops
for the first time. I looked down at the
world below. I was changed and the world was
changed. My past was the forgotten night.
Sunrise was all around me.</p>

<p>I went out from Miss Van Ness’s office, singing
a song of new life: “America! I found
America.”</p>

  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>“THE FAT OF THE LAND”</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">In</span> an air-shaft so narrow that you could touch
the next wall with your bare hands, Hanneh
Breineh leaned out and knocked on her neighbor’s
window.</p>

<p>“Can you loan me your wash-boiler for the
clothes?” she called.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz threw up the sash.</p>

<p>“The boiler? What’s the matter with yours
again? Didn’t you tell me you had it fixed already
last week?”</p>

<p>“A black year on him, the robber, the way
he fixed it! If you have no luck in this world,
then it’s better not to live. There I spent out
fifteen cents to stop up one hole, and it runs out
another. How I ate out my gall bargaining
with him he should let it down to fifteen cents!
He wanted yet a quarter, the swindler. Gottuniu!
My bitter heart on him for every penny
he took from me for nothing!”</p>

<p>“You got to watch all those swindlers, or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
they’ll steal the whites out of your eyes,” admonished
Mrs. Pelz. “You should have tried
out your boiler before you paid him. Wait a
minute till I empty out my dirty clothes in a
pillow-case; then I’ll hand it to you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz returned with the boiler and tried
to hand it across to Hanneh Breineh, but the
soap-box refrigerator on the window-sill was
in the way.</p>

<p>“You got to come in for the boiler yourself,”
said Mrs. Pelz.</p>

<p>“Wait only till I tie my Sammy on to the
high-chair he shouldn’t fall on me again. He’s
so wild that ropes won’t hold him.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh tied the child in the chair,
stuck a pacifier in his mouth, and went in to her
neighbor. As she took the boiler Mrs. Pelz said:</p>

<p>“Do you know Mrs. Melker ordered fifty
pounds of chicken for her daughter’s wedding?
And such grand chickens! Shining like gold! My
heart melted in me just looking at the flowing
fatness of those chickens.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh smacked her thin, dry lips,
a hungry gleam in her sunken eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>“Fifty pounds!” she gasped. “It ain’t possible.
How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I heard her with my own ears. I saw them
with my own eyes. And she said she will chop
up the chicken livers with onions and eggs for
an appetizer, and then she will buy twenty-five
pounds of fish, and cook it sweet and sour with
raisins, and she said she will bake all her shtrudels
on pure chicken fat.”</p>

<p>“Some people work themselves up in the
world,” sighed Hanneh Breineh. “For them is
America flowing with milk and honey. In Savel
Mrs. Melker used to get shriveled up from hunger.
She and her children used to live on potato-peelings
and crusts of dry bread picked out
from the barrels; and in America she lives to
eat chicken, and apple shtrudels soaking in
fat.”</p>

<p>“The world is a wheel always turning,”
philosophized Mrs. Pelz. “Those who were high
go down low, and those who’ve been low go up
higher. Who will believe me here in America
that in Poland I was a cook in a banker’s house?
I handled ducks and geese every day. I used to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
bake coffee-cake with cream so thick you could
cut it with a knife.”</p>

<p>“And do you think I was a nobody in Poland?”
broke in Hanneh Breineh, tears welling
in her eyes as the memories of her past rushed
over her. “But what’s the use of talking? In
America money is everything. Who cares who
my father or grandfather was in Poland? Without
money I’m a living dead one. My head
dries out worrying how to get for the children
the eating a penny cheaper.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz wagged her head, a gnawing envy
contracting her features.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Melker had it good from the day she
came,” she said, begrudgingly. “Right away
she sent all her children to the factory, and she
began to cook meat for dinner every day. She
and her children have eggs and buttered rolls
for breakfast each morning like millionaires.”</p>

<p>A sudden fall and a baby’s scream, and the
boiler dropped from Hanneh Breineh’s hands as
she rushed into her kitchen, Mrs. Pelz after her.
They found the high-chair turned on top of the
baby.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>“Gewalt! Save me! Run for a doctor!” cried
Hanneh Breineh, as she dragged the child from
under the high-chair. “He’s killed! He’s killed!
My only child! My precious lamb!” she
shrieked as she ran back and forth with the
screaming infant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz snatched little Sammy from the
mother’s hands.</p>

<p>“Meshugneh! What are you running around
like a crazy, frightening the child? Let me see.
Let me tend to him. He ain’t killed yet.” She
hastened to the sink to wash the child’s face,
and discovered a swelling lump on his forehead.
“Have you a quarter in your house?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got one,” replied Hanneh Breineh,
climbing on a chair. “I got to keep it on a high
shelf where the children can’t get it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz seized the quarter Hanneh Breineh
handed down to her.</p>

<p>“Now pull your left eyelid three times while
I’m pressing the quarter, and you’ll see the
swelling go down.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh took the child again in her
arms, shaking and cooing over it and caressing it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>“Ah-ah-ah, Sammy! Ah-ah-ah-ah, little
lamb! Ah-ah-ah, little bird! Ah-ah-ah-ah, precious
heart! Oh, you saved my life; I thought
he was killed,” gasped Hanneh Breineh, turning
to Mrs. Pelz. “Oi-i!” she sighed, “a mother’s
heart! Always in fear over her children. The
minute anything happens to them all life goes
out of me. I lose my head and I don’t know
where I am any more.”</p>

<p>“No wonder the child fell,” admonished Mrs.
Pelz. “You should have a red ribbon or red
beads on his neck to keep away the evil eye.
Wait. I got something in my machine-drawer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz returned, bringing the boiler and a
red string, which she tied about the child’s neck
while the mother proceeded to fill the boiler.</p>

<p>A little later Hanneh Breineh again came
into Mrs. Pelz’s kitchen, holding Sammy in one
arm and in the other an apronful of potatoes.
Putting the child down on the floor, she seated
herself on the unmade kitchen-bed and began
to peel the potatoes in her apron.</p>

<p>“Woe to me!” sobbed Hanneh Breineh. “To
my bitter luck there ain’t no end. With all my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
other troubles, the stove got broke. I lighted the
fire to boil the clothes, and it’s to get choked
with smoke. I paid rent only a week ago, and
the agent don’t want to fix it. A thunder should
strike him! He only comes for the rent, and if
anything has to be fixed, then he don’t want to
hear nothing.</p>

<p>“Why comes it to me so hard?” went on
Hanneh Breineh, the tears streaming down her
cheeks. “I can’t stand it no more. I came into
you for a minute to run away from my troubles.
It’s only when I sit myself down to peel potatoes
or nurse the baby that I take time to draw
a breath, and beg only for death.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz, accustomed to Hanneh Breineh’s
bitter outbursts, continued her scrubbing.</p>

<p>“Ut!” exclaimed Hanneh Breineh, irritated
at her neighbor’s silence, “what are you tearing
up the world with your cleaning? What’s the
use to clean up when everything only gets dirty
again?”</p>

<p>“I got to shine up my house for the holidays.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it so good nothing lays on your
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>
mind but to clean your house. Look on this little
blood-sucker,” said Hanneh Breineh, pointing
to the wizened child, made prematurely
solemn from starvation and neglect. “Could
anybody keep that brat clean? I wash him one
minute, and he is dirty the minute after.” Little
Sammy grew frightened and began to cry.
“Shut up!” ordered the mother, picking up the
child to nurse it again. “Can’t you see me take
a rest for a minute?”</p>

<p>The hungry child began to cry at the top of
its weakened lungs.</p>

<p>“Na, na, you glutton.” Hanneh Breineh took
out a dirty pacifier from her pocket and stuffed
it into the baby’s mouth. The grave, pasty-faced
infant shrank into a panic of fear, and
chewed the nipple nervously, clinging to it with
both his thin little hands.</p>

<p>“For what did I need yet the sixth one?”
groaned Hanneh Breineh, turning to Mrs. Pelz.
“Wasn’t it enough five mouths to feed? If I
didn’t have this child on my neck, I could turn
myself around and earn a few cents.” She
wrung her hands in a passion of despair. “Gottuniu!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
The earth should only take it before it
grows up!”</p>

<p>“Shah! Shah!” reproved Mrs. Pelz. “Pity
yourself on the child. Let it grow up already so
long as it is here. See how frightened it looks on
you.” Mrs. Pelz took the child in her arms and
petted it. “The poor little lamb! What did it
done you should hate it so?”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh pushed Mrs. Pelz away
from her.</p>

<p>“To whom can I open the wounds of my
heart?” she moaned. “Nobody has pity on me.
You don’t believe me, nobody believes me until
I’ll fall down like a horse in the middle of the
street. Oi weh! Mine life is so black for my
eyes! Some mothers got luck. A child gets run
over by a car, some fall from a window, some
burn themselves up with a match, some get
choked with diphtheria; but no death takes
mine away.”</p>

<p>“God from the world, stop cursing!” admonished
Mrs. Pelz. “What do you want from
the poor children? Is it their fault that their
father makes small wages? Why do you let it all
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
out on them?” Mrs. Pelz sat down beside Hanneh
Breineh. “Wait only till your children get
old enough to go to the shop and earn money,”
she consoled. “Push only through those few years
while they are yet small; your sun will begin to
shine; you will live on the fat of the land, when
they begin to bring you in the wages each week.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>“Till they are old enough to go to the shop
and earn money they’ll eat the head off my
bones,” she wailed. “If you only knew the fights
I got by each meal. Maybe I gave Abe a bigger
piece of bread than Fanny. Maybe Fanny got a
little more soup in her plate than Jake. Eating
is dearer than diamonds. Potatoes went up a
cent on a pound, and milk is only for millionaires.
And once a week, when I buy a little
meat for the Sabbath, the butcher weighs it for
me like gold, with all the bones in it. When I
come to lay the meat out on a plate and divide
it up, there ain’t nothing to it but bones. Before,
he used to throw me in a piece of fat extra
or a piece of lung, but now you got to pay for
everything, even for a bone to the soup.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>“Never mind; you’ll yet come out from all
your troubles. Just as soon as your children get
old enough to get their working papers the
more children you got, the more money you’ll
have.”</p>

<p>“Why should I fool myself with the false
shine of hope? Don’t I know it’s already my
black luck not to have it good in this world? Do
you think American children will right away
give everything they earn to their mother?”</p>

<p>“I know what is with you the matter,” said
Mrs. Pelz. “You didn’t eat yet to-day. When
it is empty in the stomach, the whole world
looks black. Come, only let me give you something
good to taste in the mouth; that will
freshen you up.” Mrs. Pelz went to the cupboard
and brought out the saucepan of gefülte
fish that she had cooked for dinner and placed it
on the table in front of Hanneh Breineh. “Give
a taste my fish,” she said, taking one slice on a
spoon, and handing it to Hanneh Breineh with
a piece of bread. “I wouldn’t give it to you on
a plate because I just cleaned up my house, and
I don’t want to dirty up more dishes.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>“What, am I a stranger you should have to
serve me on a plate yet!” cried Hanneh Breineh,
snatching the fish in her trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! How it melts through all the
bones!” she exclaimed, brightening as she ate.
“May it be for good luck to us all!” she exulted,
waving aloft the last precious bite.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz was so flattered that she even ladled
up a spoonful of gravy.</p>

<p>“There is a bit of onion and carrot in it,” she
said, as she handed it to her neighbor.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh sipped the gravy drop by
drop, like a connoisseur sipping wine.</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h! A taste of that gravy lifts me up to
heaven!” As she disposed leisurely of the slice
of onion and carrot she relaxed and expanded
and even grew jovial. “Let us wish all our
troubles on the Russian Czar! Let him burst
with our worries for rent! Let him get shriveled
with our hunger for bread! Let his eyes dry
out of his head looking for work!</p>

<p>“Shah! I’m forgetting from everything,”
she exclaimed, jumping up. “It must be eleven
or soon twelve, and my children will be right
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>
away out of school and fall on me like a pack of
wild wolves. I better quick run to the market
and see what cheaper I can get for a quarter.”</p>

<p>Because of the lateness of her coming, the
stale bread at the nearest bakeshop was sold
out, and Hanneh Breineh had to trudge from
shop to shop in search of the usual bargain, and
spent nearly an hour to save two cents.</p>

<p>In the meantime the children returned from
school, and, finding the door locked, climbed
through the fire-escape, and entered the house
through the window. Seeing nothing on the
table, they rushed to the stove. Abe pulled a
steaming potato out of the boiling pot, and so
scalded his fingers that the potato fell to the
floor; where upon the three others pounced on it.</p>

<p>“It was my potato,” cried Abe, blowing his
burned fingers, while with the other hand and
his foot he cuffed and kicked the three who were
struggling on the floor. A wild fight ensued, and
the potato was smashed under Abe’s foot amid
shouts and screams. Hanneh Breineh, on the
stairs, heard the noise of her famished brood, and
topped their cries with curses and invectives.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>“They are here already, the savages! They
are here already to shorten my life! They heard
you all over the hall, in all the houses around!”</p>

<p>The children, disregarding her words,
pounced on her market-basket, shouting ravenously:
“Mamma, I’m hungry! What more
do you got to eat?”</p>

<p>They tore the bread and herring out of Hanneh
Breineh’s basket and devoured it in starved
savagery, clamoring for more.</p>

<p>“Murderers!” screamed Hanneh Breineh,
goaded beyond endurance. “What are you
tearing from me my flesh? From where should I
steal to give you more? Here I had already a
pot of potatoes and a whole loaf of bread and
two herrings, and you swallowed it down in the
wink of an eye. I have to have Rockefeller’s
millions to fill your stomachs.”</p>

<p>All at once Hanneh Breineh became aware
that Benny was missing. “Oi weh!” she burst
out, wringing her hands in a new wave of woe,
“where is Benny? Didn’t he come home yet
from school?”</p>

<p>She ran out into the hall, opened the grime-coated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
window, and looked up and down the
street; but Benny was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Abe, Jake, Fanny, quick, find Benny!” entreated
Hanneh Breineh, as she rushed back
into the kitchen. But the children, anxious to
snatch a few minutes’ play before the school-call,
dodged past her and hurried out.</p>

<p>With the baby on her arm, Hanneh Breineh
hastened to the kindergarten.</p>

<p>“Why are you keeping Benny here so long?”
she shouted at the teacher as she flung open the
door. “If you had my bitter heart, you would
send him home long ago and not wait till I got
to come for him.”</p>

<p>The teacher turned calmly and consulted her
record-cards.</p>

<p>“Benny Safron? He wasn’t present this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Not here?” shrieked Hanneh Breineh. “I
pushed him out myself he should go. The
children didn’t want to take him, and I had
no time. Woe is me! Where is my child?” She
began pulling her hair and beating her breast
as she ran into the street.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>Mrs. Pelz was busy at a pushcart, picking
over some spotted apples, when she heard the
clamor of an approaching crowd. A block off
she recognized Hanneh Breineh, her hair disheveled,
her clothes awry, running toward her
with her yelling baby in her arms, the crowd
following.</p>

<p>“Friend mine,” cried Hanneh Breineh, falling
on Mrs. Pelz’s neck, “I lost my Benny,
the best child of all my children.” Tears
streamed down her red, swollen eyes as she
sobbed. “Benny! mine heart, mine life! Oi-i-i!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz took the frightened baby out of
the mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Still yourself a little! See how you’re frightening
your child.”</p>

<p>“Woe to me! Where is my Benny? Maybe
he’s killed already by a car. Maybe he fainted
away from hunger. He didn’t eat nothing all
day long. Gottuniu! Pity yourself on me!”</p>

<p>She lifted her hands full of tragic entreaty.</p>

<p>“People, my child! Get me my child! I’ll go
crazy out of my head! Get me my child, or I’ll
take poison before your eyes!”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>“Still yourself a little!” pleaded Mrs. Pelz.</p>

<p>“Talk not to me!” cried Hanneh Breineh,
wringing her hands. “You’re having all your
children. I lost mine. Every good luck comes to
other people. But I didn’t live yet to see a good
day in my life. Mine only joy, mine Benny, is
lost away from me.”</p>

<p>The crowd followed Hanneh Breineh as she
wailed through the streets, leaning on Mrs.
Pelz. By the time she returned to her house the
children were back from school; but seeing that
Benny was not there, she chased them out in
the street, crying:</p>

<p>“Out of here, you robbers, gluttons! Go find
Benny!” Hanneh Breineh crumpled into a
chair in utter prostration. “Oi weh! he’s lost!
Mine life; my little bird; mine only joy! How
many nights I spent nursing him when he had
the measles! And all that I suffered for weeks
and months when he had the whooping-cough!
How the eyes went out of my head till I learned
him how to walk, till I learned him how to talk!
And such a smart child! If I lost all the others,
it wouldn’t tear me so by the heart.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>She worked herself up into such a hysteria,
crying, and tearing her hair, and hitting her
head with her knuckles, that at last she fell into
a faint. It took some time before Mrs. Pelz, with
the aid of neighbors, revived her.</p>

<p>“Benny, mine angel!” she moaned as she
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Just then a policeman came in with the lost
Benny.</p>

<p>“Na, na, here you got him already!” said
Mrs. Pelz. “Why did you carry on so for nothing?
Why did you tear up the world like a
crazy?”</p>

<p>The child’s face was streaked with tears as
he cowered, frightened and forlorn. Hanneh
Breineh sprang toward him, slapping his cheeks,
boxing his ears, before the neighbors could rescue
him from her.</p>

<p>“Woe on your head!” cried the mother.
“Where did you lost yourself? Ain’t I got
enough worries on my head than to go around
looking for you? I didn’t have yet a minute’s
peace from that child since he was born!”</p>

<p>“See a crazy mother!” remonstrated Mrs.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
Pelz, rescuing Benny from another beating.
“Such a mouth! With one breath she blesses
him when he is lost, and with the other breath
she curses him when he is found.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh took from the window-sill a
piece of herring covered with swarming flies,
and putting it on a slice of dry bread, she filled
a cup of tea that had been stewing all day, and
dragged Benny over to the table to eat.</p>

<p>But the child, choking with tears, was unable
to touch the food.</p>

<p>“Go eat!” commanded Hanneh Breineh.
“Eat and choke yourself eating!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>“Maybe she won’t remember me no more.
Maybe the servant won’t let me in,” thought
Mrs. Pelz, as she walked by the brownstone
house on Eighty-Fourth Street where she had
been told Hanneh Breineh now lived. At last
she summoned up enough courage to climb the
steps. She was all out of breath as she rang the
bell with trembling fingers. “Oi weh! even the
outside smells riches and plenty! Such curtains!
And shades on all windows like by millionaires!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
Twenty years ago she used to eat from the pot
to the hand, and now she lives in such a palace.”</p>

<p>A whiff of steam-heated warmth swept over
Mrs. Pelz as the door opened, and she saw her
old friend of the tenements dressed in silk and
diamonds like a being from another world.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Pelz, is it you!” cried Hanneh Breineh,
overjoyed at the sight of her former neighbor.
“Come right in. Since when are you back in
New York?”</p>

<p>“We came last week,” mumbled Mrs. Pelz, as
she was led into a richly carpeted reception-room.</p>

<p>“Make yourself comfortable. Take off your
shawl,” urged Hanneh Breineh.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pelz only drew her shawl more
tightly around her, a keen sense of her poverty
gripping her as she gazed, abashed by the luxurious
wealth that shone from every corner.</p>

<p>“This shawl covers up my rags,” she said,
trying to hide her shabby sweater.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what; come right into the
kitchen,” suggested Hanneh Breineh. “The
servant is away for this afternoon, and we can
feel more comfortable there. I can breathe like
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
a free person in my kitchen when the girl has
her day out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz glanced about her in an excited
daze. Never in her life had she seen anything
so wonderful as a white-tiled kitchen, with its
glistening porcelain sink and the aluminum pots
and pans that shone like silver.</p>

<p>“Where are you staying now?” asked Hanneh
Breineh, as she pinned an apron over her
silk dress.</p>

<p>“I moved back to Delancey Street, where
we used to live,” replied Mrs. Pelz, as she seated
herself cautiously in a white enameled chair.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! What grand times we had in that
old house when we were neighbors!” sighed
Hanneh Breineh, looking at her old friend with
misty eyes.</p>

<p>“You still think on Delancey Street? Haven’t
you more high-class neighbors uptown here?”</p>

<p>“A good neighbor is not to be found every
day,” deplored Hanneh Breineh. “Uptown
here, where each lives in his own house, nobody
cares if the person next door is dying or going
crazy from loneliness. It ain’t anything like we
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
used to have it in Delancey Street, when we
could walk into one another’s rooms without
knocking, and borrow a pinch of salt or a pot
to cook in.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh went over to the pantry-shelf.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a bite right here on
the kitchen-table like on Delancey Street. So
long there’s no servant to watch us we can eat
what we please.”</p>

<p>“Oi! How it waters my mouth with appetite,
the smell of the herring and onion!” chuckled
Mrs. Pelz, sniffing the welcome odors with
greedy pleasure.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh pulled a dish-towel from
the rack and threw one end of it to Mrs. Pelz.</p>

<p>“So long there’s no servant around, we can
use it together for a napkin. It’s dirty, anyhow.
How it freshens up my heart to see you!” she
rejoiced as she poured out her tea into a saucer.
“If you would only know how I used to beg my
daughter to write for me a letter to you; but
these American children, what is to them a
mother’s feelings?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>“What are you talking!” cried Mrs. Pelz.
“The whole world rings with you and your
children. Everybody is envying you. Tell me
how began your luck?”</p>

<p>“You heard how my husband died with consumption,”
replied Hanneh Breineh. “The
five hundred dollars lodge money gave me the
first lift in life, and I opened a little grocery
store. Then my son Abe married himself to a
girl with a thousand dollars. That started him
in business, and now he has the biggest shirt-waist
factory on West Twenty-Ninth Street.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard your son had a factory.” Mrs.
Pelz hesitated and stammered; “I’ll tell you the
truth. What I came to ask you&mdash;I thought
maybe you would beg your son Abe if he would
give my husband a job.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Hanneh Breineh. “He
keeps more than five hundred hands. I’ll ask
him if he should take in Mr. Pelz.”</p>

<p>“Long years on you, Hanneh Breineh!
You’ll save my life if you could only help my
husband get work.”</p>

<p>“Of course my son will help him. All my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>
children like to do good. My daughter Fanny
is a milliner on Fifth Avenue, and she takes in
the poorest girls in her shop and even pays
them sometimes while they learn the trade.”
Hanneh Breineh’s face lit up, and her chest
filled with pride as she enumerated the successes
of her children. “And my son Benny he wrote
a play on Broadway and he gave away more
than a hundred free tickets for the first night.”</p>

<p>“Benny? The one who used to get lost from
home all the time? You always did love that
child more than all the rest. And what is
Sammy your baby doing?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t a baby no longer. He goes to college
and quarterbacks the football team. They
can’t get along without him.</p>

<p>“And my son Jake, I nearly forgot him. He
began collecting rent in Delancey Street, and
now he is boss of renting the swellest apartment-houses
on Riverside Drive.”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you? In America children
are like money in the bank,” purred Mrs. Pelz,
as she pinched and patted Hanneh Breineh’s
silk sleeve. “Oi weh! How it shines from you!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>
You ought to kiss the air and dance for joy and
happiness. It is such a bitter frost outside; a
pail of coal is so dear, and you got it so warm
with steam heat. I had to pawn my feather bed
to have enough for the rent, and you are rolling
in money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I got it good in some ways, but money
ain’t everything,” sighed Hanneh Breineh.</p>

<p>“You ain’t yet satisfied?”</p>

<p>“But here I got no friends,” complained
Hanneh Breineh.</p>

<p>“Friends?” queried Mrs. Pelz. “What greater
friend is there on earth than the dollar?”</p>

<p>“Oi! Mrs. Pelz; if you could only look into
my heart! I’m so choked up! You know they
say a cow has a long tongue, but can’t talk.”
Hanneh Breineh shook her head wistfully, and
her eyes filmed with inward brooding. “My
children give me everything from the best.
When I was sick, they got me a nurse by day
and one by night. They bought me the best
wine. If I asked for dove’s milk, they would
buy it for me; but&mdash;but&mdash;I can’t talk myself
out in their language. They want to make
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
me over for an American lady, and I’m different.”
Tears cut their way under her eyelids
with a pricking pain as she went on: “When I
was poor, I was free, and could holler and do
what I like in my own house. Here I got to lie
still like a mouse under a broom. Between living
up to my Fifth-Avenue daughter and keeping
up with the servants, I am like a sinner in
the next world that is thrown from one hell to
another.” The doorbell rang, and Hanneh
Breineh jumped up with a start.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! It must be the servant back already!”
she exclaimed, as she tore off her apron.
“Oi weh! Let’s quickly put the dishes together in
a dish-pan. If she sees I eat on the kitchen table,
she will look on me like the dirt under her feet.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz seized her shawl in haste.</p>

<p>“I better run home quick in my rags before
your servant sees me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to Abe about the job,” said Hanneh
Breineh, as she pushed a bill into the hand of
Mrs. Pelz, who edged out as the servant entered.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>“I’m having fried potato lotkes special for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>
you, Benny,” said Hanneh Breineh, as the children
gathered about the table for the family
dinner given in honor of Benny’s success with
his new play. “Do you remember how you used
to lick the fingers from them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” reproved Fanny. “Anyone
hearing you would think we were still in the
pushcart district.”</p>

<p>“Stop your nagging, sis, and let ma alone,”
commanded Benny, patting his mother’s arm
affectionately. “I’m home only once a month.
Let her feed me what she pleases. My stomach
is bomb-proof.”</p>

<p>“Do I hear that the President is coming to
your play?” said Abe, as he stuffed a napkin
over his diamond-studded shirt-front.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he come?” returned Benny.
“The critics say it’s the greatest antidote for
the race hatred created by the war. If you want
to know, he is coming to-night; and what’s
more, our box is next to the President’s.”</p>

<p>“Nu, mammeh,” sallied Jake, “did you
ever dream in Delancey Street that we should
rub sleeves with the President?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>“I always said that Benny had more head
than the rest of you,” replied the mother.</p>

<p>As the laughter died away, Jake went on:</p>

<p>“Honor you are getting plenty; but how
much mezummen does this play bring you?
Can I invest any of it in real estate for you?”</p>

<p>“I’m getting ten per cent royalties of the
gross receipts,” replied the youthful playwright.</p>

<p>“How much is that?” queried Hanneh
Breineh.</p>

<p>“Enough to buy up all your fish-markets in
Delancey Street,” laughed Abe in good-natured
raillery at his mother.</p>

<p>Her son’s jest cut like a knife-thrust in her
heart. She felt her heart ache with the pain that
she was shut out from their successes. Each
added triumph only widened the gulf. And when
she tried to bridge this gulf by asking questions,
they only thrust her back upon herself.</p>

<p>“Your fame has even helped me get my hat
trade solid with the Four Hundred,” put in
Fanny. “You bet I let Mrs. Van Suyden know
that our box is next to the President’s. She said
she would drop in to meet you. Of course she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
let on to me that she hadn’t seen the play yet,
though my designer said she saw her there on
the opening night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gosh, the toadies!” sneered Benny.
“Nothing so sickens you with success as the
way people who once shoved you off the sidewalk
come crawling to you on their stomachs
begging you to dine with them.”</p>

<p>“Say, that leading man of yours he’s some
class!” cried Fanny. “That’s the man I’m
looking for. Will you invite him to supper after
the theater?”</p>

<p>The playwright turned to his mother.</p>

<p>“Say, ma,” he said, laughingly, “how would
you like a real actor for a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“She should worry,” mocked Sam. “She’ll
be discussing with him the future of the Greek
drama. Too bad it doesn’t happen to be Warfield,
or mother could give him tips on the
‘Auctioneer.’”</p>

<p>Jake turned to his mother with a covert
grin.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d have no objection if Fanny
got next to Benny’s leading man. He makes at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>
least fifteen hundred a week. That wouldn’t be
such a bad addition to the family, would it?”</p>

<p>Again the bantering tone stabbed Hanneh
Breineh. Everything in her began to tremble
and break loose.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask me?” she cried, throwing
her napkin into her plate. “Do I count for a
person in this house? If I’ll say something, will
you even listen to me? What is to me the grandest
man that my daughter could pick out? Another
enemy in my house! Another person to
shame himself from me!” She swept in her
children in one glance of despairing anguish as
she rose from the table. “What worth is an old
mother to American children? The President is
coming to-night to the theater, and none of you
asked me to go.” Unable to check the rising
tears, she fled toward the kitchen and banged
the door.</p>

<p>They all looked at one another guiltily.</p>

<p>“Say, sis,” Benny called out sharply, “what
sort of frame-up is this? Haven’t you told
mother that she was to go with us to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I&mdash;” Fanny bit her lips as she fumbled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>
evasively for words. “I asked her if she
wouldn’t mind my taking her some other
time.”</p>

<p>“Now you have made a mess of it!” fumed
Benny. “Mother’ll be too hurt to go now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care,” snapped Fanny. “I
can’t appear with mother in a box at the theater.
Can I introduce her to Mrs. Van Suyden?
And suppose your leading man should ask to
meet me?”</p>

<p>“Take your time, sis. He hasn’t asked yet,”
scoffed Benny.</p>

<p>“The more reason I shouldn’t spoil my
chances. You know mother. She’ll spill the
beans that we come from Delancey Street the
minute we introduce her anywhere. Must I always
have the black shadow of my past trailing
after me?”</p>

<p>“But have you no feelings for mother?” admonished
Abe.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried harder than all of you to do my
duty. I’ve <em>lived</em> with her.” She turned angrily
upon them. “I’ve borne the shame of mother
while you bought her off with a present and a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
treat here and there. God knows how hard I
tried to civilize her so as not to have to blush
with shame when I take her anywhere. I
dressed her in the most stylish Paris models,
but Delancey Street sticks out from every inch
of her. Whenever she opens her mouth, I’m
done for. You fellows had your chance to rise in
the world because a man is free to go up as high
as he can reach up to; but I, with all my style
and pep, can’t get a man my equal because a
girl is always judged by her mother.”</p>

<p>They were silenced by her vehemence, and
unconsciously turned to Benny.</p>

<p>“I guess we all tried to do our best for
mother,” said Benny, thoughtfully. “But
wherever there is growth, there is pain and
heartbreak. The trouble with us is that the
ghetto of the Middle Ages and the children of
the twentieth century have to live under one
roof, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>A sound of crashing dishes came from the
kitchen, and the voice of Hanneh Breineh resounded
through the dining-room as she wreaked
her pent-up fury on the helpless servant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>“Oh, my nerves! I can’t stand it any more!
There will be no girl again for another week!”
cried Fanny.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up on the old lady,” protested Abe.
“Since she can’t take it out on us any more,
what harm is it if she cusses the servants?”</p>

<p>“If you fellows had to chase around employment
agencies, you wouldn’t see anything
funny about it. Why can’t we move into a hotel
that will do away with the need of servants
altogether?”</p>

<p>“I got it better,” said Jake, consulting a
notebook from his pocket. “I have on my list
an apartment on Riverside Drive where there’s
only a small kitchenette; but we can do away
with the cooking, for there is a dining service in
the building.”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The new Riverside apartment to which Hanneh
Breineh was removed by her socially ambitious
children was for the habitually active
mother an empty desert of enforced idleness.
Deprived of her kitchen, Hanneh Breineh felt
robbed of the last reason for her existence.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
Cooking and marketing and puttering busily
with pots and pans gave her an excuse for living
and struggling and bearing up with her children.
The lonely idleness of Riverside Drive
stunned all her senses and arrested all her
thoughts. It gave her that choked sense of being
cut off from air, from life, from everything
warm and human. The cold indifference, the
each-for-himself look in the eyes of the people
about her were like stinging slaps in the face.
Even the children had nothing real or human
in them. They were starched and stiff miniatures
of their elders.</p>

<p>But the most unendurable part of the stifling
life on Riverside Drive was being forced to eat
in the public dining-room. No matter how hard
she tried to learn polite table manners, she always
found people staring at her, and her daughter
rebuking her for eating with the wrong
fork or guzzling the soup or staining the cloth.</p>

<p>In a fit of rebellion Hanneh Breineh resolved
never to go down to the public dining-room
again, but to make use of the gas-stove in the
kitchenette to cook her own meals. That very
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>
day she rode down to Delancey Street and purchased
a new market-basket. For some time
she walked among the haggling pushcart venders,
relaxing and swimming in the warm waves
of her old familiar past.</p>

<p>A fish-peddler held up a large carp in his
black, hairy hand and waved it dramatically:</p>

<p>“Women! Women! Fourteen cents a pound!”</p>

<p>He ceased his raucous shouting as he saw
Hanneh Breineh in her rich attire approach his
cart.</p>

<p>“How much?” she asked, pointing to the
fattest carp.</p>

<p>“Fifteen cents, lady,” said the peddler,
smirking as he raised his price.</p>

<p>“Swindler! Didn’t I hear you call fourteen
cents?” shrieked Hanneh Breineh, exultingly,
the spirit of the penny chase surging in her
blood. Diplomatically, Hanneh Breineh turned
as if to go, and the fisherman seized her basket
in frantic fear.</p>

<p>“I should live; I’m losing money on the fish,
lady,” whined the peddler. “I’ll let it down to
thirteen cents for you only.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>“Two pounds for a quarter, and not a penny
more,” said Hanneh Breineh, thrilling again
with the rare sport of bargaining, which had
been her chief joy in the good old days of poverty.</p>

<p>“Nu, I want to make the first sale for good
luck.” The peddler threw the fish on the scale.</p>

<p>As he wrapped up the fish, Hanneh Breineh
saw the driven look of worry in his haggard
eyes, and when he counted out the change
from her dollar, she waved it aside. “Keep it
for your luck,” she said, and hurried off to strike
a new bargain at a pushcart of onions.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh returned triumphantly with
her purchases. The basket under her arm gave
forth the old, homelike odors of herring and
garlic, while the scaly tail of a four-pound carp
protruded from its newspaper wrapping. A
gilded placard on the door of the apartment-house
proclaimed that all merchandise must be
delivered through the trade entrance in the
rear; but Hanneh Breineh with her basket
strode proudly through the marble-paneled
hall and rang nonchalantly for the elevator.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>The uniformed hall-man, erect, expressionless,
frigid with dignity, stepped forward:</p>

<p>“Just a minute, madam. I’ll call a boy to
take up your basket for you.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh, glaring at him, jerked the
basket savagely from his hands. “Mind your
own business!” she retorted. “I’ll take it up
myself. Do you think you’re a Russian policeman
to boss me in my own house?”</p>

<p>Angry lines appeared on the countenance of
the representative of social decorum.</p>

<p>“It is against the rules, madam,” he said,
stiffly.</p>

<p>“You should sink into the earth with all your
rules and brass buttons. Ain’t this America?
Ain’t this a free country? Can’t I take up in my
own house what I buy with my own money?”
cried Hanneh Breineh, reveling in the opportunity
to shower forth the volley of invectives
that had been suppressed in her for the weeks
of deadly dignity of Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>In the midst of this uproar Fanny came
in with Mrs. Van Suyden. Hanneh Breineh
rushed over to her, crying:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>“This bossy policeman won’t let me take up
my basket in the elevator.”</p>

<p>The daughter, unnerved with shame and
confusion, took the basket in her white-gloved
hand and ordered the hall-boy to take it around
to the regular delivery entrance.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh was so hurt by her daughter’s
apparent defense of the hall-man’s rules
that she utterly ignored Mrs. Van Suyden’s
greeting and walked up the seven flights of
stairs out of sheer spite.</p>

<p>“You see the tragedy of my life?” broke out
Fanny, turning to Mrs. Van Suyden.</p>

<p>“You poor child! You go right up to your
dear, old lady mother, and I’ll come some
other time.”</p>

<p>Instantly Fanny regretted her words. Mrs.
Van Suyden’s pity only roused her wrath the
more against her mother.</p>

<p>Breathless from climbing the stairs, Hanneh
Breineh entered the apartment just as Fanny
tore the faultless millinery creation from her
head and threw it on the floor in a rage.</p>

<p>“Mother, you are the ruination of my life!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
You have driven away Mrs. Van Suyden, as
you have driven away all my best friends.
What do you think we got this apartment for
but to get rid of your fish smells and your
brawls with the servants? And here you come
with a basket on your arm as if you just landed
from steerage! And this afternoon, of all times,
when Benny is bringing his leading man to tea.
When will you ever stop disgracing us?”</p>

<p>“When I’m dead,” said Hanneh Breineh,
grimly. “When the earth will cover me up,
then you’ll be free to go your American way.
I’m not going to make myself over for a lady
on Riverside Drive. I hate you and all your
swell friends. I’ll not let myself be choked up
here by you or by that hall-boss policeman that
is higher in your eyes than your own mother.”</p>

<p>“So that’s your thanks for all we’ve done
for you?” cried the daughter.</p>

<p>“All you’ve done for me!” shouted Hanneh
Breineh. “What have you done for me? You
hold me like a dog on a chain! It stands in the
Talmud; some children give their mothers dry
bread and water and go to heaven for it, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
some give their mother roast duck and go to
Gehenna because it’s not given with love.”</p>

<p>“You want me to love you yet?” raged the
daughter. “You knocked every bit of love out
of me when I was yet a kid. All the memories
of childhood I have is your everlasting cursing
and yelling that we were gluttons.”</p>

<p>The bell rang sharply, and Hanneh Breineh
flung open the door.</p>

<p>“Your groceries, ma’am,” said the boy.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh seized the basket from him,
and with a vicious fling sent it rolling across the
room, strewing its contents over the Persian
rugs and inlaid floor. Then seizing her hat and
coat, she stormed out of the apartment and
down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pelz sat crouched and shivering
over their meager supper when the door
opened, and Hanneh Breineh in fur coat and
plumed hat charged into the room.</p>

<p>“I come to cry out to you my bitter heart,”
she sobbed. “Woe is me! It is so black for my
eyes!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Hanneh
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>
Breineh?” cried Mrs. Pelz in bewildered alarm.</p>

<p>“I am turned out of my own house by the
brass-buttoned policeman that bosses the elevator.
Oi-i-i-i! Weh-h-h-h! What have I from
my life? The whole world rings with my son’s
play. Even the President came to see it, and I,
his mother, have not seen it yet. My heart is
dying in me like in a prison,” she went on wailing.
“I am starved out for a piece of real eating.
In that swell restaurant is nothing but napkins
and forks and lettuce-leaves. There are a dozen
plates to every bite of food. And it looks so
fancy on the plate, but it’s nothing but straw
in the mouth. I’m starving, but I can’t swallow
down their American eating.”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh,” said Mrs. Pelz, “you
are sinning before God. Look on your fur coat;
it alone would feed a whole family for a year. I
never had yet a piece of fur trimming on a coat,
and you are in fur from the neck to the feet. I
never had yet a piece of feather on a hat, and
your hat is all feathers.”</p>

<p>“What are you envying me?” protested
Hanneh Breineh. “What have I from all my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>
fine furs and feathers when my children are
strangers to me? All the fur coats in the world
can’t warm up the loneliness inside my heart.
All the grandest feathers can’t hide the bitter
shame in my face that my children shame
themselves from me.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh suddenly loomed over them
like some ancient, heroic figure of the Bible
condemning unrighteousness.</p>

<p>“Why should my children shame themselves
from me? From where did they get the stuff to
work themselves up in the world? Did they get
it from the air? How did they get all their
smartness to rise over the people around them?
Why don’t the children of born American
mothers write my Benny’s plays? It is I, who
never had a chance to be a person, who gave
him the fire in his head. If I would have had a
chance to go to school and learn the language,
what couldn’t I have been? It is I and my
mother and my mother’s mother and my father
and father’s father who had such a black life in
Poland; it is our choked thoughts and feelings
that are flaming up in my children and making
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>
them great in America. And yet they shame
themselves from me!”</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. and Mrs. Pelz were hypnotized
by the sweep of her words. Then Hanneh
Breineh sank into a chair in utter exhaustion.
She began to weep bitterly, her body
shaking with sobs.</p>

<p>“Woe is me! For what did I suffer and hope
on my children? A bitter old age&mdash;my end.
I’m so lonely!”</p>

<p>All the dramatic fire seemed to have left her.
The spell was broken. They saw the Hanneh
Breineh of old, ever discontented, ever complaining
even in the midst of riches and plenty.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh,” said Mrs. Pelz, “the
only trouble with you is that you got it too
good. People will tear the eyes out of your head
because you’re complaining yet. If I only had
your fur coat! If I only had your diamonds! I
have nothing. You have everything. You are
living on the fat of the land. You go right back
home and thank God that you don’t have my
bitter lot.”</p>

<p>“You got to let me stay here with you,” insisted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
Hanneh Breineh. “I’ll not go back to my
children except when they bury me. When they
will see my dead face, they will understand how
they killed me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pelz glanced nervously at her husband.
They barely had enough covering for their one
bed; how could they possibly lodge a visitor?</p>

<p>“I don’t want to take up your bed,” said
Hanneh Breineh. “I don’t care if I have to
sleep on the floor or on the chairs, but I’ll stay
here for the night.”</p>

<p>Seeing that she was bent on staying, Mr.
Pelz prepared to sleep by putting a few chairs
next to the trunk, and Hanneh Breineh was invited
to share the rickety bed with Mrs. Pelz.</p>

<p>The mattress was full of lumps and hollows.
Hanneh Breineh lay cramped and miserable,
unable to stretch out her limbs. For years she
had been accustomed to hair mattresses and
ample woolen blankets, so that though she
covered herself with her fur coat, she was too
cold to sleep. But worse than the cold were the
creeping things on the wall. And as the lights
were turned low, the mice came through the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>
broken plaster and raced across the floor. The
foul odors of the kitchen-sink added to the
night of horrors.</p>

<p>“Are you going back home?” asked Mrs.
Pelz, as Hanneh Breineh put on her hat and
coat the next morning.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I’m going,” she replied,
as she put a bill into Mrs. Pelz’s hand.</p>

<p>For hours Hanneh Breineh walked through
the crowded ghetto streets. She realized that
she no longer could endure the sordid ugliness
of her past, and yet she could not go home to
her children. She only felt that she must go on
and on.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a cold, drizzling rain set in.
She was worn out from the sleepless night and
hours of tramping. With a piercing pain in her
heart she at last turned back and boarded the
subway for Riverside Drive. She had fled from
the marble sepulcher of the Riverside apartment
to her old home in the ghetto; but now
she knew that she could not live there again.
She had outgrown her past by the habits of
years of physical comforts, and these material
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>
comforts that she could no longer do without
choked and crushed the life within her.</p>

<p>A cold shudder went through Hanneh
Breineh as she approached the apartment-house.
Peering through the plate glass of the
door she saw the face of the uniformed hall-man.
For a hesitating moment she remained
standing in the drizzling rain, unable to enter,
and yet knowing full well that she would have
to enter.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Hanneh Breineh began to
laugh. She realized that it was the first time
she had laughed since her children had become
rich. But it was the hard laugh of bitter sorrow.
Tears streamed down her furrowed cheeks as
she walked slowly up the granite steps.</p>

<p>“The fat of the land!” muttered Hanneh
Breineh, with a choking sob as the hall-man
with immobile face deferentially swung open
the door&mdash;“the fat of the land!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>MY OWN PEOPLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">With</span> the suitcase containing all her worldly
possessions under her arm, Sophie Sapinsky elbowed
her way through the noisy ghetto crowds.
Pushcart peddlers and pullers-in shouted and
gesticulated. Women with market-baskets
pushed and shoved one another, eyes straining
with the one thought&mdash;how to get the food a
penny cheaper. With the same strained intentness,
Sophie scanned each tenement, searching
for a room cheap enough for her dwindling
means.</p>

<p>In a dingy basement window a crooked sign,
in straggling, penciled letters, caught Sophie’s
eye: “Room to let, a bargain, cheap.”</p>

<p>The exuberant phrasing was quite in keeping
with the extravagant dilapidation of the surroundings.
“This is the very place,” thought
Sophie. “There couldn’t be nothing cheaper
in all New York.”</p>

<p>At the foot of the basement steps she knocked.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" title="225"> </a>“Come in!” a voice answered.</p>

<p>As she opened the door she saw an old man
bending over a pot of potatoes on a shoemaker’s
bench. A group of children in all degrees
of rags surrounded him, greedily snatching
at the potatoes he handed out.</p>

<p>Sophie paused for an instant, but her absorption
in her own problem was too great to halt
the question: “Is there a room to let?”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh, in the back, has a room.”
The old man was so preoccupied filling the
hungry hands that he did not even look up.</p>

<p>Sophie groped her way to the rear hall. A
gaunt-faced woman answered her inquiry with
loquacious enthusiasm. “A grand room for the
money. I’ll let it down to you only for three
dollars a month. In the whole block is no
bigger bargain. I should live so.”</p>

<p>As she talked, the woman led her through the
dark hall into an airshaft room. A narrow window
looked out into the bottom of a chimney-like
pit, where lay the accumulated refuse from
a score of crowded kitchens.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” gasped Sophie, throwing open the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" title="226"> </a>
sash. “No air and no light. Outside shines the
sun and here it’s so dark.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so dark. It’s only a little shady.
Let me only turn up the gas for you and you’ll
quick see everything like with sunshine.”</p>

<p>The claw-fingered flame revealed a rusty,
iron cot, an inverted potato barrel that served
for a table, and two soap-boxes for chairs.</p>

<p>Sophie felt of the cot. It sagged and flopped
under her touch. “The bed has only three feet!”
she exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>“You can’t have Rockefeller’s palace for
three dollars a month,” defended Hanneh
Breineh, as she shoved one of the boxes under
the legless corner of the cot. “If the bed ain’t
so steady, so you got good neighbors. Upstairs
lives Shprintzeh Gittle, the herring-woman.
You can buy by her the biggest bargains in fish,
a few days older…. What she got left over from
the Sabbath, she sells to the neighbors cheap….
In the front lives Shmendrik, the shoemaker.
I’ll tell you the truth, he ain’t no real shoemaker.
He never yet made a pair of whole shoes
in his life. He’s a learner from the old country&mdash;a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" title="227"> </a>
tzadik, a saint; but every time he sees in
the street a child with torn feet, he calls them
in and patches them up. His own eating, the last
bite from his mouth, he divides up with them.”</p>

<p>“Three dollars,” deliberated Sophie, scarcely
hearing Hanneh Breineh’s chatter. “I will
never find anything cheaper. It has a door to
lock and I can shut this woman out … I’ll take
it,” she said, handing her the money.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh kissed the greasy bills
gloatingly. “I’ll treat you like a mother! You’ll
have it good by me like in your own home.”</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;but I got no time to shmoos. I
got to be alone to get my work done.”</p>

<p>The rebuff could not penetrate Hanneh Breineh’s
joy over the sudden possession of three
dollars.</p>

<p>“Long years on you! May we be to good
luck to one another!” was Hanneh Breineh’s
blessing as she closed the door.</p>

<p>Alone in her room&mdash;<em>her</em> room, securely
hers&mdash;yet with the flash of triumph, a stab of
bitterness. All that was hers&mdash;so wretched and
so ugly! Had her eager spirit, eager to give and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" title="228"> </a>
give, no claim to a bit of beauty&mdash;a shred of
comfort?</p>

<p>Perhaps her family was right in condemning
her rashness. Was it worth while to give up the
peace of home, the security of a regular job&mdash;suffer
hunger, loneliness, and want&mdash;for what?
For something she knew in her heart was beyond
her reach. Would her writing ever amount
to enough to vindicate the uprooting of her
past? Would she ever become articulate enough
to express beautifully what she saw and felt?
What had she, after all, but a stifling, sweatshop
experience, a meager, night-school education,
and this wild, blind hunger to release the
dumbness that choked her?</p>

<p>Sophie spread her papers on the cot beside
her. Resting her elbows on the potato barrel,
she clutched her pencil with tense fingers. In
the notebook before her were a hundred beginnings,
essays, abstractions, outbursts of chaotic
moods. She glanced through the titles: “Believe
in Yourself,” “The Quest of the Ideal.”</p>

<p>Meaningless tracings on the paper, her words
seemed to her now&mdash;a restless spirit pawing at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" title="229"> </a>
the air. The intensity of experience, the surge
of emotion that had been hers when she wrote&mdash;where
were they? The words had failed to
catch the life-beat&mdash;had failed to register the
passion she had poured into them.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not a writer, after all. Had
the years and years of night-study been in vain?
Choked with discouragement, the cry broke
from her, “O&mdash;God&mdash;God help me! I feel&mdash;I
see, but it all dies in me&mdash;dumb!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Tedious days passed into weeks. Again
Sophie sat staring into her notebook. “There’s
nothing here that’s alive. Not a word yet says
what’s in me&nbsp;…</p>

<p>“But it <em>is</em> in me!” With clenched fist she
smote her bosom. “It must be in me! I believe
in it! I got to get it out&mdash;even if it tears my
flesh in pieces&mdash;even if it kills me!…</p>

<p>“But these words&mdash;these flat, dead words&nbsp;…</p>

<p>“Whether I can write or can’t write&mdash;I
can’t stop writing. I can’t rest. I can’t breathe.
There’s no peace, no running away for me on
earth except in the struggle to give out what’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" title="230"> </a>
in me. The beat from my heart&mdash;the blood
from my veins&mdash;must flow out into my words.”</p>

<p>She returned to her unfinished essay, “Believe
in Yourself.” Her mind groping&mdash;clutching
at the misty incoherence that clouded her
thoughts&mdash;she wrote on.</p>

<p>“These sentences are yet only wood&mdash;lead;
but I can’t help it&mdash;I’ll push on&mdash;on&mdash;I’ll
not eat&mdash;I’ll not sleep&mdash;I’ll not move from
this spot till I get it to say on the paper what I
got in my heart!”</p>

<p>Slowly the dead words seemed to begin to
breathe. Her eyes brightened. Her cheeks
flushed. Her very pencil trembled with the
eager onrush of words.</p>

<p>Then a sharp rap sounded on her door. With
a gesture of irritation Sophie put down her
pencil and looked into the burning, sunken eyes
of her neighbor, Hanneh Breineh.</p>

<p>“I got yourself a glass of tea, good friend. It
ain’t much I got to give away, but it’s warm
even if it’s nothing.”</p>

<p>Sophie scowled. “You mustn’t bother yourself
with me. I’m so busy&mdash;thanks.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" title="231"> </a>“Don’t thank me yet so quick. I got no
sugar.” Hanneh Breineh edged herself into the
room confidingly. “At home, in Poland, I not
only had sugar for tea&mdash;but even jelly&mdash;a
jelly that would lift you up to heaven. I thought
in America everything would be so plenty, I
could drink the tea out from my sugar-bowl.
But ach! Not in Poland did my children starve
like in America!”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh, in a friendly manner, settled
herself on the sound end of the bed, and
began her jeremiad.</p>

<p>“Yosef, my man, ain’t no bread-giver. Already
he got consumption the second year. One
week he works and nine weeks he lays sick.”</p>

<p>In despair Sophie gathered her papers, wondering
how to get the woman out of her room.
She glanced through the page she had written,
but Hanneh Breineh, unconscious of her indifference,
went right on.</p>

<p>“How many times it is tearing the heart
out from my body&mdash;should I take Yosef’s
milk to give to the baby, or the baby’s milk to
give to Yosef? If he was dead the pensions they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" title="232"> </a>
give to widows would help feed my children.
Now I got only the charities to help me. A
black year on them! They should only have to
feed their own children on what they give me.”</p>

<p>Resolved not to listen to the intruder, Sophie
debated within herself: “Should I call my essay
‘Believe in Yourself,’ or wouldn’t it be
stronger to say, ‘Trust Yourself’? But if I say,
‘Trust Yourself,’ wouldn’t they think that I
got the words from Emerson?”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh’s voice went on, but it
sounded to Sophie like a faint buzzing from
afar. “Gotteniu! How much did it cost me my
life to go and swear myself that my little Fannie&mdash;only
skin and bones&mdash;that she is already
fourteen! How it chokes me the tears every
morning when I got to wake her and push her
out to the shop when her eyes are yet shutting
themselves with sleep!”</p>

<p>Sophie glanced at her wrist-watch as it
ticked away the precious minutes. She must get
rid of the woman! Had she not left her own
sister, sacrificed all comfort, all association,
for solitude and its golden possibilities? For the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" title="233"> </a>
first time in her life she had the chance to be
by herself and think. And now, the thoughts
which a moment ago had seemed like a flock
of fluttering birds had come so close&mdash;and this
woman with her sordid wailing had scattered
them.</p>

<p>“I’m a savage, a beast, but I got to ask her
to get out&mdash;this very minute,” resolved
Sophie. But before she could summon the courage
to do what she wanted to do, there was a
timid knock at the door, and the wizened little
Fannie, her face streaked with tears, stumbled in.</p>

<p>“The inspector said it’s a lie. I ain’t yet
fourteen,” she whimpered.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh paled. “Woe is me! Sent
back from the shop? God from the world&mdash;is
there no end to my troubles? Why didn’t you
hide yourself when you saw the inspector
come?”</p>

<p>“I was running to hide myself under the
table, but she caught me and she said she’ll
take me to the Children’s Society and arrest
me and my mother for sending me to work too
soon.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" title="234"> </a>“Arrest me?” shrieked Hanneh Breineh,
beating her breast. “Let them only come and
arrest me! I’ll show America who I am!
Let them only begin themselves with me!…
Black is for my eyes … the groceryman will
not give us another bread till we pay him the
bill!”</p>

<p>“The inspector said&nbsp;…” The child’s brow
puckered in an effort to recall the words.</p>

<p>“What did the inspector said? Gotteniu!”
Hanneh Breineh wrung her hands in passionate
entreaty. “Listen only once to my prayer! Send
on the inspector only a quick death! I only wish
her to have her own house with twenty-four
rooms and each of the twenty-four rooms should
be twenty-four beds and the chills and the
fever should throw her from one bed to another!”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh, still yourself a little,” entreated
Sophie.</p>

<p>“How can I still myself without Fannie’s
wages? Bitter is me! Why do I have to live so
long?”</p>

<p>“The inspector said&nbsp;…”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" title="235"> </a>“What did the inspector said? A thunder
should strike the inspector! Ain’t I as good a
mother as other mothers? Wouldn’t I better
send my children to school? But who’ll give us
to eat? And who’ll pay us the rent?”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh wiped her red-lidded eyes
with the corner of her apron.</p>

<p>“The president from America should only
come to my bitter heart. Let him go fighting
himself with the pushcarts how to get the eating
a penny cheaper. Let him try to feed his
children on the money the charities give me and
we’d see if he wouldn’t better send his littlest
ones to the shop better than to let them starve
before his eyes. Woe is me! What for did I come
to America? What’s my life&mdash;nothing but one
terrible, never-stopping fight with the grocer
and the butcher and the landlord&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>Suddenly Sophie’s resentment for her lost
morning was forgotten. The crying waste of
Hanneh Breineh’s life lay open before her eyes
like pictures in a book. She saw her own life
in Hanneh Breineh’s life. Her efforts to write
were like Hanneh Breineh’s efforts to feed her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" title="236"> </a>
children. Behind her life and Hanneh Breineh’s
life she saw the massed ghosts of thousands
upon thousands beating&mdash;beating out their
hearts against rock barriers.</p>

<p>“The inspector said&nbsp;…” Fannie timidly attempted
again to explain.</p>

<p>“The inspector!” shrieked Hanneh Breineh,
as she seized hold of Fannie in a rage. “Hellfire
should burn the inspector! Tell me again
about the inspector and I’ll choke the life out
from you&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sophie sprang forward to protect the child
from the mother. “She’s only trying to tell
you something.”</p>

<p>“Why should she yet throw salt on my
wounds? If there was enough bread in the house
would I need an inspector to tell me to send her
to school? If America is so interested in poor
people’s children, then why don’t they give
them to eat till they should go to work? What
learning can come into a child’s head when the
stomach is empty?”</p>

<p>A clutter of feet down the creaking cellar
steps, a scuffle of broken shoes, and a chorus of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" title="237"> </a>
shrill voices, as the younger children rushed in
from school.</p>

<p>“Mamma&mdash;what’s to eat?”</p>

<p>“It smells potatoes!”</p>

<p>“Pfui! The pot is empty! It smells over from
Cohen’s.”</p>

<p>“Jake grabbed all the bread!”</p>

<p>“Mamma&mdash;he kicked the piece out from my
hands!”</p>

<p>“Mamma&mdash;it’s so empty in my stomach!
Ain’t there nothing?”</p>

<p>“Gluttons&mdash;wolves&mdash;thieves!” Hanneh
Breineh shrieked. “I should only live to bury
you all in one day!”</p>

<p>The children, regardless of Hanneh Breineh’s
invectives, swarmed around her like hungry
bees, tearing at her apron, her skirt. Their
voices rose in increased clamor, topped only by
their mother’s imprecations. “Gotteniu! Tear
me away from these leeches on my neck! Send
on them only a quick death!… Only a minute’s
peace before I die!”</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh&mdash;children! What’s the
matter?” Shmendrik stood at the door. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" title="238"> </a>
sweet quiet of the old man stilled the raucous
voices as the coming of evening stills the noises
of the day.</p>

<p>“There’s no end to my troubles! Hear them
hollering for bread, and the grocer stopped to
give till the bill is paid. Woe is me! Fannie sent
home by the inspector and not a crumb in the
house!”</p>

<p>“I got something.” The old man put his
hands over the heads of the children in silent
benediction. “All come in by me. I got sent me
a box of cake.”</p>

<p>“Cake!” The children cried, catching at the
kind hands and snuggling about the shabby coat.</p>

<p>“Yes. Cake and nuts and raisins and even a
bottle of wine.”</p>

<p>The children leaped and danced around him
in their wild burst of joy.</p>

<p>“Cake and wine&mdash;a box&mdash;to you? Have
the charities gone crazy?” Hanneh Breineh’s
eyes sparkled with light and laughter.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no,” Shmendrik explained hastily.
“Not from the charities&mdash;from a friend&mdash;for
the holidays.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" title="239"> </a>Shmendrik nodded invitingly to Sophie, who
was standing in the door of her room. “The
roomerkeh will also give a taste with us our
party?”</p>

<p>“Sure will she!” Hanneh Breineh took Sophie
by the arm. “Who’ll say no in this black
life to cake and wine?”</p>

<p>Young throats burst into shrill cries: “Cake
and wine&mdash;wine and cake&mdash;raisins and nuts&mdash;nuts
and raisins!” The words rose in a triumphant
chorus. The children leaped and
danced in time to their chant, almost carrying
the old man bodily into his room in the wildness
of their joy.</p>

<p>The contagion of this sudden hilarity erased
from Sophie’s mind the last thought of work
and she found herself seated with the others
on the cobbler’s bench.</p>

<p>From under his cot the old man drew forth
a wooden box. Lifting the cover he held up before
wondering eyes a large frosted cake embedded
in raisins and nuts.</p>

<p>Amid the shouts of glee Shmendrik now
waved aloft a large bottle of grape-juice.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" title="240"> </a>The children could contain themselves no
longer and dashed forward.</p>

<p>“Shah&mdash;shah! Wait only!” He gently halted
their onrush and waved them back to their seats.</p>

<p>“The glasses for the wine!” Hanneh Breineh
rushed about hither and thither in happy confusion.
From the sink, the shelf, the window-sill,
she gathered cracked glasses, cups without
handles&mdash;anything that would hold even a
few drops of the yellow wine.</p>

<p>Sacrificial solemnity filled the basement as
the children breathlessly watched Shmendrik
cut the precious cake. Mouths&mdash;even eyes&mdash;watered
with the intensity of their emotion.</p>

<p>With almost religious fervor Hanneh Breineh
poured the grape-juice into the glasses held in
the trembling hands of the children. So overwhelming
was the occasion that none dared to
taste till the ritual was completed. The suspense
was agonizing as one and all waited for
Shmendrik’s signal.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh&mdash;you drink from my Sabbath
wine-glass!”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh clinked glasses with Schmendrik.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" title="241"> </a>
“Long years on you&mdash;long years on us
all!” Then she turned to Sophie, clinked glasses
once more. “May you yet marry yourself from
our basement to a millionaire!” Then she
lifted the glass to her lips.</p>

<p>The spell was broken. With a yell of triumph
the children gobbled the cake in huge mouthfuls
and sucked the golden liquid. All the traditions
of wealth and joy that ever sparkled
from the bubbles of champagne smiled at
Hanneh Breineh from her glass of California
grape-juice.</p>

<p>“Ach!” she sighed. “How good it is to forget
your troubles, and only those that’s got troubles
have the chance to forget them!”</p>

<p>She sipped the grape-juice leisurely, thrilled
into ecstacy with each lingering drop. “How it
laughs yet in me, the life, the minute I turn my
head from my worries!”</p>

<p>With growing wonder in her eyes, Sophie
watched Hanneh Breineh. This ragged wreck
of a woman&mdash;how passionately she clung
to every atom of life! Hungrily, she burned
through the depths of every experience. How
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" title="242"> </a>
she flared against wrongs&mdash;and how every
tiny spark of pleasure blazed into joy!</p>

<p>Within a half-hour this woman had touched
the whole range of human emotions, from bitterest
agony to dancing joy. The terrible despair
at the onrush of her starving children when
she cried out, “O that I should only bury
you all in one day!” And now the leaping light
of the words: “How it laughs yet in me, the
life, the minute I turn my head from my worries.”</p>

<p>“Ach, if I could only write like Hanneh
Breineh talks!” thought Sophie. “Her words
dance with a thousand colors. Like a rainbow
it flows from her lips.” Sentences from her own
essays marched before her, stiff and wooden.
How clumsy, how unreal, were her most labored
phrases compared to Hanneh Breineh’s
spontaneity. Fascinated, she listened to Hanneh
Breineh, drinking her words as a thirst-perishing
man drinks water. Every bubbling phrase
filled her with a drunken rapture to create.</p>

<p>“Up till now I was only trying to write from
my head. It wasn’t real&mdash;it wasn’t life. Hanneh
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" title="243"> </a>
Breineh is real. Hanneh Breineh is life.”</p>

<p>“Ach! What do the rich people got but dried-up
dollars? Pfui on them and their money!”
Hanneh Breineh held up her glass to be refilled.
“Let me only win a fortune on the lotteree and
move myself in my own bought house. Let me
only have my first hundred dollars in the bank
and I’ll lift up my head like a person and tell
the charities to eat their own cornmeal. I’ll get
myself an automobile like the kind rich ladies
and ride up to their houses on Fifth Avenue and
feed them only once on the eating they like so
good for me and my children.”</p>

<p>With a smile of benediction Shmendrik refilled
the glasses and cut for each of his guests
another slice of cake. Then came the handful of
nuts and raisins.</p>

<p>As the children were scurrying about for
hammers and iron lasts with which to crack
their nuts, the basement door creaked. Unannounced,
a woman entered&mdash;the “friendly
visitor” of the charities. Her look of awful
amazement swept the group of merrymakers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" title="244"> </a>“Mr. Shmendrik!&mdash;Hanneh Breineh!” Indignation
seethed in her voice. “What’s this?
A feast&mdash;a birthday?”</p>

<p>Gasps&mdash;bewildered glances&mdash;a struggle for
utterance!</p>

<p>“I came to make my monthly visit&mdash;evidently
I’m not needed.”</p>

<p>Shmendrik faced the accusing eyes of the
“friendly visitor.” “Holiday eating&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;I’m glad you’re so prosperous.”</p>

<p>Before any one had gained presence of mind
enough to explain things, the door had clanked.
The “friendly visitor” had vanished.</p>

<p>“Pfui!” Hanneh Breineh snatched up her
glass and drained its contents. “What will she
do now? Will we get no more dry bread from
the charities because once we ate cake?”</p>

<p>“What for did she come?” asked Sophie.</p>

<p>“To see that we don’t over-eat ourselves!”
returned Hanneh Breineh. “She’s a ‘friendly
visitor’! She learns us how to cook cornmeal.
By pictures and lectures she shows us how the
poor people should live without meat, without
milk, without butter, and without eggs. Always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" title="245"> </a>
it’s on the end of my tongue to ask her,
‘You learned us to do without so much, why
can’t you yet learn us how to eat without eating?’”</p>

<p>The children seized the last crumbs of cake
that Shmendrik handed them and rushed for
the street.</p>

<p>“What a killing look was on her face,” said
Sophie. “Couldn’t she be a little glad for your
gladness?”</p>

<p>“Charity ladies&mdash;gladness?” The joy of the
grape-wine still rippled in Hanneh Breineh’s
laughter. “For poor people is only cornmeal.
Ten cents a day&mdash;to feed my children!”</p>

<p>Still in her rollicking mood Hanneh Breineh
picked up the baby and tossed it like a Bacchante.
“Could you be happy a lot with ten
cents in your stomach? Ten cents&mdash;half a can
of condensed milk&mdash;then fill yourself the rest
with water!… Maybe yet feed you with all
water and save the ten-cent pieces to buy you a
carriage like the Fifth Avenue babies!…”</p>

<p>The soft sound of a limousine purred through
the area grating and two well-fed figures in seal-skin
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" title="246"> </a>
coats, led by the “friendly visitor,” appeared
at the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bernstein, you can see for yourself.”
The “friendly visitor” pointed to the table.</p>

<p>The merry group shrank back. It was as if a
gust of icy wind had swept all the joy and
laughter from the basement.</p>

<p>“You are charged with intent to deceive and
obtain assistance by dishonest means,” said
Mr. Bernstein.</p>

<p>“Dishonest?” Shmendrik paled.</p>

<p>Sophie’s throat strained with passionate protest,
but no words came to her release.</p>

<p>“A friend&mdash;a friend”&mdash;stammered Shmendrik&mdash;“sent
me the holiday eating.”</p>

<p>The superintendent of the Social Betterment
Society faced him accusingly. “You told
us that you had no friends when you applied
to us for assistance.”</p>

<p>“My friend&mdash;he knew me in my better
time.” Shmendrik flushed painfully. “I was
once a scholar&mdash;respected. I wanted by this
one friend to hold myself like I was.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bernstein had taken from the bookshelf
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_247" title="247"> </a>
a number of letters, glanced through them
rapidly and handed them one by one to the
deferential superintendent.</p>

<p>Shmendrik clutched at his heart in an agony
of humiliation. Suddenly his bent body straightened.
His eyes dilated. “My letters&mdash;my life&mdash;you
dare?”</p>

<p>“Of course we dare!” The superintendent
returned Shmendrik’s livid gaze, made bold by
the confidence that what he was doing was the
only scientific method of administering philanthropy.
“These dollars, so generously given,
must go to those most worthy…. I find in
these letters references to gifts of fruit and
other luxuries you did not report at our office.”</p>

<p>“He never kept nothing for himself!” Hanneh
Breineh broke in defensively. “He gave it
all for the children.”</p>

<p>Ignoring the interruption Mr. Bernstein
turned to the “friendly visitor.” “I’m glad
you brought my attention to this case. It’s but
one of the many impositions on our charity …
Come&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>“Kossacks! Pogromschiks!” Sophie’s rage
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_248" title="248"> </a>
broke at last. “You call yourselves Americans?
You dare call yourselves Jews? You bosses of
the poor! This man Shmendrik, whose house
you broke into, whom you made to shame
like a beggar&mdash;he is the one Jew from whom
the Jews can be proud! He gives all he is&mdash;all
he has&mdash;as God gives. <em>He is</em> charity.</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;you are the greed&mdash;the shame
of the Jews! <em>All-right-niks</em>&mdash;fat bellies in fur
coats! What do you give from yourselves? You
may eat and bust eating! Nothing you give till
you’ve stuffed yourselves so full that your
hearts are dead!”</p>

<p>The door closed in her face. Her wrath fell on
indifferent backs as the visitors mounted the
steps to the street.</p>

<p>Shmendrik groped blindly for the Bible. In a
low, quavering voice, he began the chant of the
oppressed&mdash;the wail of the downtrodden. “I
am afraid, and a trembling taketh hold of my
flesh. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old,
yea, mighty in power?”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh and the children drew close
around the old man. They were weeping&mdash;unconscious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" title="249"> </a>
of their weeping&mdash;deep-buried
memories roused by the music, the age-old
music of the Hebrew race.</p>

<p>Through the grating Sophie saw the limousine
pass. The chant flowed on: “Their houses
are safe from fear; neither is the rod of God
upon them.”</p>

<p>Silently Sophie stole back to her room. She
flung herself on the cot, pressed her fingers to
her burning eyeballs. For a long time she lay
rigid, clenched&mdash;listening to the drumming of
her heart like the sea against rock barriers.
Presently the barriers burst. Something in her
began pouring itself out. She felt for her pencil&mdash;paper&mdash;and
began to write. Whether
she reached out to God or man she knew not,
but she wrote on and on all through that night.</p>

<p>The gray light entering her grated window
told her that beyond was dawn. Sophie looked
up: “Ach! At last it writes itself in me!” she
whispered triumphantly. “It’s not me&mdash;it’s
their cries&mdash;my own people&mdash;crying in me!
Hanneh Breineh, Shmendrik, they will not be
stilled in me, till all America stops to listen.”</p>

<h3>Part I</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Every</span> breath I drew was a breath of fear,
every shadow a stifling shock, every footfall
struck on my heart like the heavy boot of the
Cossack.</p>

<p>On a low stool in the middle of the only room
in our mud hut sat my father&mdash;his red beard
falling over the Book of Isaiah open before him.
On the tile stove, on the benches that were our
beds, even on the earthen floor, sat the neighbors’
children, learning from him the ancient
poetry of the Hebrew race.</p>

<p>As he chanted, the children repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" title="251"> </a>Undisturbed by the swaying and chanting of
teacher and pupils, old Kakah, our speckled
hen, with her brood of chicks, strutted and
pecked at the potato-peelings which fell from
my mother’s lap, as she prepared our noon
meal.</p>

<p>I stood at the window watching the road, lest
the Cossack come upon us unawares to enforce
the ukaz of the Czar, which would tear the bread
from our mouths: “No Chadir [Hebrew school]
shall be held in a room used for cooking and
sleeping.”</p>

<p>With one eye I watched ravenously my
mother cutting chunks of black bread. At last
the potatoes were ready. She poured them out
of the iron pot into a wooden bowl and placed
them in the center of the table.</p>

<p>Instantly the swaying and chanting ceased,
the children rushed forward. The fear of the
Cossacks was swept away from my heart by
the fear that the children would get my potato.</p>

<p>The sentry deserted his post. With a shout of
joy I seized my portion and bit a huge mouthful
of mealy delight.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" title="252"> </a>At that moment the door was driven open by
the blow of an iron heel. The Cossack’s whip
swished through the air. Screaming, we scattered.</p>

<p>The children ran out&mdash;our livelihood gone
with them.</p>

<p>“Oi weh,” wailed my mother, clutching her
breast, “is there a God over us&mdash;and sees all
this?”</p>

<p>With grief-glazed eyes my father muttered a
broken prayer as the Cossack thundered the
ukaz: “A thousand rubles fine or a year in
prison if you are ever found again teaching
children where you’re eating and sleeping.”</p>

<p>“Gottuniu!” pleaded my mother, “would
you tear the last skin from our bones? Where
else can we be eating and sleeping? Or should
we keep chadir in the middle of the road? Have
we houses with separate rooms like the Czar?”</p>

<p>Ignoring my mother’s entreaties the Cossack
strode out of the hut. My father sank into a
chair, his head bowed in the silent grief of the
helpless.</p>

<p>“God from the world”&mdash;my mother wrung
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" title="253"> </a>
her hands&mdash;“is there no end to our troubles?
When will the earth cover me and my woes?”</p>

<p>I watched the Cossack disappear down the
road. All at once I saw the whole village running
toward us. I dragged my mother to the
window to see the approaching crowd.</p>

<p>“Gewalt! What more is falling over our
heads?” she cried in alarm.</p>

<p>Masheh Mindel, the water-carrier’s wife,
headed a wild procession. The baker, the
butcher, the shoemaker, the tailor, the goat-herd,
the workers of the fields, with their wives
and children, pressed toward us through a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>Masheh Mindel, almost fainting, fell in front
of the doorway. “A letter from America!” she
gasped.</p>

<p>“A letter from America!” echoed the crowd,
as they snatched the letter from her and thrust
it into my father’s hands.</p>

<p>“Read! Read!” they shouted tumultuously.</p>

<p>My father looked through the letter, his lips
uttering no sound. In breathless suspense the
crowd gazed at him. Their eyes shone with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" title="254"> </a>
wonder and reverence for the only man in the
village who could read.</p>

<p>Masheh Mindel crouched at his feet, her neck
stretched toward him to catch each precious
word of the letter.</p>

<p>“To my worthy wife, Masheh Mindel, and
to my loving son, Susha Feifel, and to my
precious darling daughter, the apple of my eye,
the pride of my life, Tzipkeleh!</p>

<p>“Long years and good luck on you! May the
blessings from heaven fall over your beloved
heads and save you from all harm!</p>

<p>“First I come to tell you that I am well and
in good health. May I hear the same from you.</p>

<p>“Secondly, I am telling you that my sun is
beginning to shine in America. I am becoming
a person&mdash;a business man.</p>

<p>“I have for myself a stand in the most
crowded part of America, where people are as
thick as flies and every day is like market-day
by a fair. My business is from bananas and apples.
The day begins with my pushcart full of
fruit, and the day never ends before I count up
at least $2.00 profit&mdash;that means four rubles.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" title="255"> </a>
Stand before your eyes … I … Gedalyeh
Mindel, four rubles a day, twenty-four rubles a
week!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>“Gedalyeh Mindel, the water-carrier, twenty-four
roubles a week&nbsp;…” The words leaped
like fire in the air.</p>

<p>We gazed at his wife, Masheh Mindel&mdash;a
dried-out bone of a woman.</p>

<p>“Masheh Mindel, with a husband in America&mdash;Masheh
Mindel, the wife of a man earning
twenty-four rubles a week!”</p>

<p>We looked at her with new reverence. Already
she was a being from another world. The
dead, sunken eyes became alive with light. The
worry for bread that had tightened the skin of
her cheek-bones was gone. The sudden surge of
happiness filled out her features, flushing her
face as with wine.</p>

<p>The two starved children clinging to her
skirts, dazed with excitement, only dimly realized
their good fortune by the envious glances
of the others.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, I come to tell you,” the letter
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" title="256"> </a>
went on, “white bread and meat I eat every
day just like the millionaires.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, I have to tell you that I am no
more Gedalyeh Mindel&mdash;<em>Mister</em> Mindel they
call me in America.</p>

<p>“Fifthly, Masheh Mindel and my dear children,
in America there are no mud huts where
cows and chickens and people live all together.
I have for myself a separate room with a closed
door, and before any one can come to me, I can
give a say, ‘Come in,’ or ‘Stay out,’ like a king
in a palace.</p>

<p>“Lastly, my darling family and people of the
Village of Sukovoly, there is no Czar in America.”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>My father paused; the hush was stifling. No
Czar&mdash;no Czar in America! Even the little
babies repeated the chant: “No Czar in America!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>“In America they ask everybody who should
be the President, and I, Gedalyeh Mindel, when
I take out my Citizens papers, will have as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" title="257"> </a>
much to say who shall be the next President in
America, as Mr. Rockefeller the greatest millionaire.</p>

<p>“Fifty rubles I am sending you for your
ship-ticket to America. And may all Jews who
suffer in Goluth from ukazes and pogroms live
yet to lift up their heads like me, Gedalyeh
Mindel, in America.”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Fifty rubles! A ship-ticket to America! That
so much good luck should fall on one head! A
savage envy bit me. Gloomy darts from narrowed
eyes stabbed Masheh Mindel.</p>

<p>Why should not we too have a chance to get
away from this dark land? Has not every heart
the same hunger for America? The same longing
to live and laugh and breathe like a free
human being? America is for all. Why should
only Masheh Mindel and her children have a
chance to the new world?</p>

<p>Murmuring and gesticulating the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>Each one knew every one else’s thought:
How to get to America. What could they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" title="258"> </a>
pawn? From where could they borrow for a
ship-ticket?</p>

<p>Silently we followed my father back into the
hut from which the Cossack had driven us a
while before.</p>

<p>We children looked from mother to father
and from father to mother.</p>

<p>“Gottuniu! The Czar himself is pushing us
to America by this last ukaz.” My mother’s
face lighted up the hut like a lamp.</p>

<p>“Meshugeneh Yidini!” admonished my father.
“Always your head in the air. What&mdash;where&mdash;America?
With what money? Can
dead people lift themselves up to dance?”</p>

<p>“Dance?” The samovar and the brass pots
rang and reëchoed with my mother’s laughter.
“I could dance myself over the waves of the
ocean to America.”</p>

<p>In amazed delight at my mother’s joy we
children rippled and chuckled with her.</p>

<p>My father paced the room&mdash;his face dark
with dread for the morrow.</p>

<p>“Empty hands&mdash;empty pockets&mdash;yet it
dreams itself in you America.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_259" title="259"> </a>“Who is poor who has hopes on America?”
flaunted my mother.</p>

<p>“Sell my red quilted petticoat that grandmother
left for my dowry,” I urged in excitement.</p>

<p>“Sell the feather beds, sell the samovar,”
chorused the children.</p>

<p>“Sure we can sell everything&mdash;the goat
and all the winter things,” added my mother;
“it must be always summer in America.”</p>

<p>I flung my arms around my brother and he
seized Bessie by the curls, and we danced about
the room crazy with joy.</p>

<p>“Beggars!” laughed my mother, “why are
you so happy with yourselves? How will you go
to America without a shirt on your back&mdash;without
shoes on your feet?”</p>

<p>But we ran out into the road, shouting and
singing: “We’ll sell everything we got&mdash;we’ll
go to America.”</p>

<p>“White bread and meat we’ll eat every day&mdash;in
America! In America!”</p>

<p>That very evening we fetched Berel Zalman,
the usurer, and showed him all our treasures,
piled up in the middle of the hut.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" title="260"> </a>“Look, all these fine feather beds, Berel Zalman,”
urged my mother; “this grand fur coat
came from Nijny itself. My grandfather
bought it at the fair.”</p>

<p>I held up my red quilted petticoat, the supreme
sacrifice of my ten-year-old life.</p>

<p>Even my father shyly pushed forward the
samovar. “It can hold enough tea for the whole
village.”</p>

<p>“Only a hundred rubles for them all,”
pleaded my mother; “only enough to lift us to
America. Only one hundred little rubles.”</p>

<p>“A hundred rubles? Pfui!” sniffed the pawnbroker.
“Forty is overpaid. Not even thirty is
it worth.”</p>

<p>But coaxing and cajoling my mother got a
hundred rubles out of him.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Steerage&mdash;dirty bundles&mdash;foul odors&mdash;seasick
humanity&mdash;but I saw and heard
nothing of the foulness and ugliness around
me. I floated in showers of sunshine; visions
upon visions of the new world opened before
me.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" title="261"> </a>From lips to lips flowed the golden legend of
the golden country:</p>

<p>“In America you can say what you feel&mdash;you
can voice your thoughts in the open streets
without fear of a Cossack.”</p>

<p>“In America is a home for everybody. The
land is your land. Not like in Russia where you
feel yourself a stranger in the village where you
were born and raised&mdash;the village in which
your father and grandfather lie buried.”</p>

<p>“Everybody is with everybody alike, in
America. Christians and Jews are brothers together.”</p>

<p>“An end to the worry for bread. An end to
the fear of the bosses over you. Everybody can
do what he wants with his life in America.”</p>

<p>“There are no high or low in America. Even
the President holds hands with Gedalyeh Mindel.”</p>

<p>“Plenty for all. Learning flows free like milk
and honey.”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>“Learning flows free.”</p>

<p>The words painted pictures in my mind. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" title="262"> </a>
saw before me free schools, free colleges, free
libraries, where I could learn and learn and
keep on learning.</p>

<p>In our village was a school, but only for
Christian children. In the schools of America I’d
lift up my head and laugh and dance&mdash;a child
with other children. Like a bird in the air, from
sky to sky, from star to star, I’d soar and soar.</p>

<p>“Land! Land!” came the joyous shout.</p>

<p>“America! We’re in America!” cried my
mother, almost smothering us in her rapture.</p>

<p>All crowded and pushed on deck. They
strained and stretched to get the first glimpse
of the “golden country,” lifting their children
on their shoulders that they might see beyond
them.</p>

<p>Men fell on their knees to pray. Women
hugged their babies and wept. Children danced.
Strangers embraced and kissed like old friends.
Old men and women had in their eyes a look of
young people in love.</p>

<p>Age-old visions sang themselves in me&mdash;songs
of freedom of an oppressed people.</p>

<p>America!&mdash;America!</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" title="263"> </a>Part II</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Between</span> buildings that loomed like mountains,
we struggled with our bundles, spreading
around us the smell of the steerage. Up Broadway,
under the bridge, and through the swarming
streets of the ghetto, we followed Gedalyeh
Mindel.</p>

<p>I looked about the narrow streets of squeezed-in
stores and houses, ragged clothes, dirty
bedding oozing out of the windows, ash-cans
and garbage-cans cluttering the side-walks. A
vague sadness pressed down my heart&mdash;the
first doubt of America.</p>

<p>“Where are the green fields and open spaces
in America?” cried my heart. “Where is the
golden country of my dreams?”</p>

<p>A loneliness for the fragrant silence of the
woods that lay beyond our mud hut welled up
in my heart, a longing for the soft, responsive
earth of our village streets. All about me was
the hardness of brick and stone, the stinking
smells of crowded poverty.</p>

<p>“Here’s your house with separate rooms like
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" title="264"> </a>
in a palace.” Gedalyeh Mindel flung open the
door of a dingy, airless flat.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” my mother cried in dismay.
“Where’s the sunshine in America?”</p>

<p>She went to the window and looked out at
the blank wall of the next house. “Gottuniu!
Like in a grave so dark&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so dark, it’s only a little shady.”
Gedalyeh Mindel lighted the gas. “Look only”&mdash;he
pointed with pride to the dim gaslight.
“No candles, no kerosene lamps in America,
you turn on a screw and put to it a match and
you got it light like with sunshine.”</p>

<p>Again the shadow fell over me, again the
doubt of America!</p>

<p>In America were rooms without sunlight,
rooms to sleep in, to eat in, to cook in, but
without sunshine. And Gedalyeh Mindel was
happy. Could I be satisfied with just a place to
sleep and eat in, and a door to shut people out&mdash;to
take the place of sunlight? Or would I always
need the sunlight to be happy?</p>

<p>And where was there a place in America for
me to play? I looked out into the alley below
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" title="265"> </a>
and saw pale-faced children scrambling in the
gutter. “Where is America?” cried my heart.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>My eyes were shutting themselves with
sleep. Blindly, I felt for the buttons on my
dress, and buttoning I sank back in sleep again&mdash;the
deadweight sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Heart of mine!” my mother’s voice moaned
above me. “Father is already gone an hour. You
know how they’ll squeeze from you a nickel for
every minute you’re late. Quick only!”</p>

<p>I seized my bread and herring and tumbled
down the stairs and out into the street. I ate
running, blindly pressing through the hurrying
throngs of workers&mdash;my haste and fear choking
each mouthful.</p>

<p>I felt a strangling in my throat as I neared
the sweatshop prison; all my nerves screwed together
into iron hardness to endure the day’s
torture.</p>

<p>For an instant I hesitated as I faced the
grated window of the old dilapidated building&mdash;dirt
and decay cried out from every crumbling
brick.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" title="266"> </a>In the maw of the shop, raging around me the
roar and the clatter, the clatter and the roar,
the merciless grind of the pounding machines.
Half maddened, half deadened, I struggled to
think, to feel, to remember&mdash;what am I&mdash;who
am I&mdash;why was I here?</p>

<p>I struggled in vain&mdash;bewildered and lost in
a whirlpool of noise.</p>

<p>“America&mdash;America&mdash;where was America?”
it cried in my heart.</p>

<p>The factory whistle&mdash;the slowing-down of
the machines&mdash;the shout of release hailing the
noon hour.</p>

<p>I woke as from a tense nightmare&mdash;a weary
waking to pain.</p>

<p>In the dark chaos of my brain reason began
to dawn. In my stifled heart feelings began to
pulse. The wound of my wasted life began to
throb and ache. My childhood choked with
drudgery&mdash;must my youth too die&mdash;unlived?</p>

<p>The odor of herring and garlic&mdash;the ravenous
munching of food&mdash;laughter and loud, vulgar
jokes. Was it only I who was so wretched?
I looked at those around me. Were they happy
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" title="267"> </a>
or only insensible to their slavery? How could
they laugh and joke? Why were they not torn
with rebellion against this galling grind&mdash;the
crushing, deadening movements of the body,
where only hands live and hearts and brains
must die?</p>

<p>A touch on my shoulder. I looked up. It was
Yetta Solomon from the machine next to mine.</p>

<p>“Here’s your tea.”</p>

<p>I stared at her, half hearing.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you going to eat nothing?”</p>

<p>“Oi weh! Yetta! I can’t stand it!” The cry
broke from me. “I didn’t come to America to
turn into a machine. I came to America to
make from myself a person. Does America
want only my hands&mdash;only the strength of
my body&mdash;not my heart&mdash;not my feelings&mdash;my
thoughts?”</p>

<p>“Our heads ain’t smart enough,” said Yetta,
practically. “We ain’t been to school like the
American-born.”</p>

<p>“What for did I come to America but to go
to school&mdash;to learn&mdash;to think&mdash;to make
something beautiful from my life&nbsp;…”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" title="268"> </a>“Sh-sh! Sh-sh! The boss&mdash;the boss!” came
the warning whisper.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell over the shop as the boss
entered. He raised his hand.</p>

<p>Breathless silence.</p>

<p>The hard, red face with pig’s eyes held us
under its sickening spell. Again I saw the Cossack
and heard him thunder the ukaz.</p>

<p>Prepared for disaster, the girls paled as they
cast at each other sidelong, frightened glances.</p>

<p>“Hands,” he addressed us, fingering the gold
watch-chain that spread across his fat belly,
“it’s slack in the other trades and I can get
plenty girls begging themselves to work for half
what you’re getting&mdash;only I ain’t a skinner. I
always give my hands a show to earn their
bread. From now on, I’ll give you fifty cents a
dozen shirts instead of seventy-five, but I’ll
give you night-work, so you needn’t lose nothing.”
And he was gone.</p>

<p>The stillness of death filled the shop. Each
one felt the heart of the other bleed with her
own helplessness.</p>

<p>A sudden sound broke the silence. A woman
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" title="269"> </a>
sobbed chokingly. It was Balah Rifkin, a
widow with three children.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” She tore at her scrawny neck.
“The blood-sucker&mdash;the thief! How will I
give them to eat&mdash;my babies&mdash;my babies&mdash;my
hungry little lambs!”</p>

<p>“Why do we let him choke us?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents less on a dozen&mdash;how
will we be able to live?”</p>

<p>“He tears the last skin from our bones!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t nobody speak up to him?”</p>

<p>“Tell him he couldn’t crush us down to
worse than we had in Russia?”</p>

<p>“Can we help ourselves? Our life lies in his
hands.”</p>

<p>Something in me forced me forward. Rage at
the bitter greed tore me. Our desperate helplessness
drove me to strength.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to the boss!” I cried, my nerves
quivering with fierce excitement. “I’ll tell him
Balah Rifkin has three hungry mouths to feed.”</p>

<p>Pale, hungry faces thrust themselves toward
me, thin, knotted hands reached out, starved
bodies pressed close about me.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" title="270"> </a>“Long years on you!” cried Balah Rifkin,
drying her eyes with a corner of her shawl.</p>

<p>“Tell him about my old father and me, his
only bread-giver,” came from Bessie Sopolsky,
a gaunt-faced girl with a hacking cough.</p>

<p>“And I got no father or mother and four of
them younger than me hanging on my neck.”
Jennie Feist’s beautiful young face was already
scarred with the gray worries of age.</p>

<p>America, as the oppressed of all lands have
dreamed America to be, and America <em>as it is</em>,
flashed before me&mdash;a banner of fire! Behind
me I felt masses pressing&mdash;thousands of immigrants&mdash;thousands
upon thousands crushed
by injustice, lifted me as on wings.</p>

<p>I entered the boss’s office without a shadow
of fear. I was not I&mdash;the wrongs of my people
burned through me till I felt the very flesh of
my body a living flame of rebellion.</p>

<p>I faced the boss.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand it!” I cried. “Even as it is
we’re hungry. Fifty cents a dozen would starve
us. Can you, a Jew, tear the bread from another
Jew’s mouth?”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" title="271"> </a>“You, fresh mouth, you! Who are you to
learn me my business?”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you yourself once a machine slave&mdash;your
life in the hands of your boss?”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;loaferin&mdash;money for nothing you
want! The minute they begin to talk English
they get flies in their nose…. A black year on
you&mdash;trouble-maker! I’ll have no smart heads
in my shop! Such freshness! Out you get …
out from my shop!”</p>

<p>Stunned and hopeless, the wings of my courage
broken, I groped my way back to them&mdash;back
to the eager, waiting faces&mdash;back to the
crushed hearts aching with mine.</p>

<p>As I opened the door they read our defeat in
my face.</p>

<p>“Girls!” I held out my hands. “He’s fired
me.”</p>

<p>My voice died in the silence. Not a girl
stirred. Their heads only bent closer over their
machines.</p>

<p>“Here, you! Get yourself out of here!” The
boss thundered at me. “Bessie Sopolsky and
you, Balah Rifkin, take out her machine into
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" title="272"> </a>
the hall…. I want no big-mouthed Americanerins
in my shop.”</p>

<p>Bessie Sopolsky and Balah Rifkin, their eyes
black with tragedy, carried out my machine.</p>

<p>Not a hand was held out to me, not a face
met mine. I felt them shrink from me as I
passed them on my way out.</p>

<p>In the street I found I was crying. The new
hope that had flowed in me so strong bled out
of my veins. A moment before, our togetherness
had made me believe us so strong&mdash;and now I
saw each alone&mdash;crushed&mdash;broken. What
were they all but crawling worms, servile grubbers
for bread?</p>

<p>I wept not so much because the girls had deserted
me, but because I saw for the first time
how mean, how vile, were the creatures with
whom I had to work. How the fear for bread
had dehumanized their last shred of humanity!
I felt I had not been working among human beings,
but in a jungle of savages who had to eat
one another alive in order to survive.</p>

<p>And then, in the very bitterness of my resentment,
the hardness broke in me. I saw the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" title="273"> </a>
girls through their own eyes as if I were inside
of them. What else could they have done? Was
not an immediate crust of bread for Balah
Rifkin’s children more urgent than truth&mdash;more
vital than honor?</p>

<p>Could it be that they ever had dreamed of
America as I had dreamed? Had their faith in
America wholly died in them? Could my faith
be killed as theirs had been?</p>

<p>Gasping from running, Yetta Solomon flung
her arms around me.</p>

<p>“You golden heart! I sneaked myself out
from the shop&mdash;only to tell you I’ll come to
see you to-night. I’d give the blood from under
my nails for you&mdash;only I got to run back&mdash;I
got to hold my job&mdash;my mother&mdash;”</p>

<p>I hardly saw or heard her&mdash;my senses
stunned with my defeat. I walked on in a blind
daze&mdash;feeling that any moment I would drop in
the middle of the street from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>Every hope I had clung to&mdash;every human
stay&mdash;every reality was torn from under me.
I sank in bottomless blackness. I had only one
wish left&mdash;to die.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" title="274"> </a>Was it then only a dream&mdash;a mirage of the
hungry-hearted people in the desert lands of
oppression&mdash;this age-old faith in America&mdash;the
beloved, the prayed-for “golden country”?</p>

<p>Had the starved villagers of Sukovoly lifted
above their sorrows a mere rainbow vision that
led them&mdash;where&mdash;where? To the stifling
submission of the sweatshop or the desperation
of the streets!</p>

<p>“O God! What is there beyond this hell?”
my soul cried in me. “Why can’t I make a
quick end to myself?”</p>

<p>A thousand voices within me and about me
answered:</p>

<p>“My faith is dead, but in my blood their
faith still clamors and aches for fulfillment&mdash;<em>dead
generations whose faith though beaten back
still presses on&mdash;a resistless, deathless force!</em></p>

<p>“In this America that crushes and kills me,
their spirit drives me on&mdash;to struggle&mdash;to
suffer&mdash;but never to submit.”</p>

<p>In my desperate darkness their lost lives
loomed&mdash;a living flame of light. Again I saw
the mob of dusty villagers crowding around
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" title="275"> </a>
my father as he read the letter from America&mdash;their
eager faces thrust out&mdash;their eyes blazing
with the same hope, the same age-old faith
that drove me on&mdash;</p>

<p>A sudden crash against my back. Dizzy with
pain I fell&mdash;then all was darkness and quiet.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>I opened my eyes. A white-clad figure bent
over me. Had I died? Was I in the heaven of
the new world&mdash;in America?</p>

<p>My eyes closed again. A misty happiness
filled my being.</p>

<p>“Learning flows free like milk and honey,”
it dreamed itself in me.</p>

<p>I was in my heaven&mdash;in the schools of
America&mdash;in open, sunny fields&mdash;a child
with other children. Our lesson-books were
singing birds and whispering trees&mdash;chanting
brooks and beckoning skies. We breathed in
learning and wisdom as naturally as flowers
breathe in sunlight.</p>

<p>After our lessons were over, we all joined
hands skipping about like a picture of dancing
fairies I had once seen in a shop-window.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" title="276"> </a>I was so full of the joy of togetherness&mdash;the
great wonder of the new world; it pressed on
my heart like sorrow. Slowly, I stole away from
the other children into silent solitude, wrestling
and praying to give out what surged in me into
some form of beauty. And out of my struggle
to shape my thoughts beautifully, a great song
filled the world.</p>

<p>“Soon she’s all right to come back to the
shop&mdash;yes, nurse?” The voice of Yetta Solomon
broke into my dreaming.</p>

<p>Wearily I opened my eyes. I saw I was still
on earth.</p>

<p>Yetta’s broad, generous face smiled anxiously
at me. “Lucky yet the car that run you over
didn’t break your hands or your feet. So long
you got yet good hands you’ll soon be back by
the machine.”</p>

<p>“Machine?” I shuddered. “I can’t go back
to the shop again. I got so used to sunlight
and quiet in the hospital I’ll not be able to
stand the hell again.”</p>

<p>“Shah!&mdash;Shah!” soothed Yetta. “Why
don’t you learn yourself to take life like it is?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" title="277"> </a>
What’s got to be, got to be. In Russia, you
could hope to run away from your troubles to
America. But from America where can you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I sighed. “In the blackest days of
Russia, there was always the hope from America.
In Russia we had only a mud hut; not
enough to eat and always the fear from the
Cossack, but still we managed to look up to
the sky, to dream, to think of the new world
where we’ll have a chance to be people, not
slaves.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use to think so much? It only
eats up the flesh from your bones. Better
rest&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>“How can I rest when my choked-in thoughts
tear me to pieces? I need school more than a
starving man needs bread.”</p>

<p>Yetta’s eyes brooded over me. Suddenly a
light broke. “I got an idea. There’s a new
school for greenhorns where they learn them
anything they want&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;where?” I raised myself quickly,
hot with eagerness. “How do you know from
it&mdash;tell me only&mdash;quick&mdash;since when&mdash;”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" title="278"> </a>“The girl next door by my house&mdash;she
used to work by cigars&mdash;and now she learns
there.”</p>

<p>“What does she learn?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get yourself so excited. Your eyes
are jumping out from your head.”</p>

<p>I fell back weakly: “Oi weh! Tell me!” I
begged.</p>

<p>“All I know is that she likes what she learns
better than rolling cigars. And it’s called ‘School
for Immigrant Girls.’”</p>

<p>“Your time is up. Another visitor is waiting
to come in,” said the nurse.</p>

<p>As Yetta walked out, my mother, with the
shawl over her head, rushed in and fell on my
bed kissing me.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! Oi weh! Half my life is out from
me from fright. How did all happen?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry yourself so. I’m nearly well
already and will go back to work soon.”</p>

<p>“Talk not work. Get only a little flesh on
your bones. They say they send from the hospital
people to the country. Maybe they’ll send
you.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" title="279"> </a>“But how will you live without my wages?”</p>

<p>“Davy is already peddling with papers and
Bessie is selling lolly-pops after school in the
park. Yesterday she brought home already
twenty-eight cents.”</p>

<p>For all her efforts to be cheerful, I looked at
her pinched face and wondered if she had eaten
that day.</p>

<p>Released from the hospital, I started home.
As I neared Allen Street, the terror of the dark
rooms swept over me. “No&mdash;no&mdash;I can’t
yet go back to the darkness and the stinking
smells,” I said to myself. “So long they’re
getting along without my wages, let them
think I went to the country and let me try out
that school for immigrants that Yetta told me
about.”</p>

<p>So I went to the Immigrant School.</p>

<p>A tall, gracious woman received me, not an
employee, but a benefactress.</p>

<p>The love that had rushed from my heart toward
the Statue in the Bay, rushed out to Mrs.
Olney. She seemed to me the living spirit of
America. All that I had ever dreamed America
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" title="280"> </a>
to be shone to me out of the kindness of her
brown eyes. She would save me from the sordidness
that was crushing me I felt the moment I
looked at her. Sympathy and understanding
seemed to breathe from her serene presence.</p>

<p>I longed to open my heart to her, but I was
so excited I didn’t know where to begin.</p>

<p>“I’m crazy to learn!” I gasped breathlessly,
and then the very pressure of the things I had
to say choked me.</p>

<p>An encouraging smile warmed the fine
features.</p>

<p>“What trade would you like to learn&mdash;sewing-machine
operating?”</p>

<p>“Sewing-machine operating?” I cried. “Oi
weh!” I shuddered. “Only the thought ‘machine’
kills me. Even when I only look on
clothes, it weeps in me when I think how the
seams from everything people wear is sweated
in the shop.”</p>

<p>“Well, then”&mdash;putting a kind hand on my
shoulder&mdash;“how would you like to learn to
cook? There’s a great need for trained servants
and you’d get good wages and a pleasant home.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" title="281"> </a>“Me&mdash;a servant?” I flung back her hand.
“Did I come to America to make from myself
a cook?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Olney stood abashed a moment. “Well,
my dear,” she said deliberately, “what would
you like to take up?”</p>

<p>“I got ideas how to make America better,
only I don’t know how to say it out. Ain’t
there a place I can learn?”</p>

<p>A startled woman stared at me. For a moment
not a word came. Then she proceeded
with the same kind smile. “It’s nice of you to
want to help America, but I think the best way
would be for you to learn a trade. That’s what
this school is for, to help girls find themselves,
and the best way to do is to learn something
useful.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t thoughts useful? Does America want
only the work from my body, my hands? Ain’t
it thoughts that turn over the world?”</p>

<p>“Ah! But we don’t want to turn over the
world.” Her voice cooled.</p>

<p>“But there’s got to be a change in America!”
I cried. “Us immigrants want to be people&mdash;not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_282" title="282"> </a>
‘hands’&mdash;not slaves of the belly! And
it’s the chance to think out thoughts that
makes people.”</p>

<p>“My child, thought requires leisure. The
time will come for that. First you must learn
to earn a good living.”</p>

<p>“Did I come to America for a living?”</p>

<p>“What did you come for?”</p>

<p>“I came to give out all the fine things that
was choked in me in Russia. I came to help
America make the new world…. They said,
in America I could open up my heart and fly
free in the air&mdash;to sing&mdash;to dance&mdash;to
live&mdash;to love…. Here I got all those grand
things in me, and America won’t let me give
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you made a mistake in coming to
this country. Your own land might appreciate
you more.” A quick glance took me in from head
to foot. “I’m afraid that you have come to the
wrong place. We only teach trades here.”</p>

<p>She turned to her papers and spoke over her
shoulder. “I think you will have to go elsewhere
if you want to set the world on fire.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h3><a class="pagenum" name="Page_283" title="283"> </a>Part III</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Blind</span> passion swayed me as I walked out of
the Immigrant School, not knowing where I was
going, not caring. One moment I was swept
with the fury of indignation, the next moment
bent under the burden of despair. But out of
this surging conflict one thought&mdash;one truth
gradually grew clearer and clearer to me: Without
comprehension, the immigrant would forever
remain shut out&mdash;a stranger in America.
Until America can release the heart as well as
train the hand of the immigrant, he would forever
remain driven back upon himself, corroded
by the very richness of the unused gifts within
his soul.</p>

<p>I longed for a friend&mdash;a real American
friend&mdash;some one different from Mrs. Olney,
some one who would understand this vague,
blind hunger for release that consumed me.
But how, where could I find such a friend?</p>

<p>As I neared the house we lived in, I paused
terror-stricken. On the sidewalk stood a jumbled
pile of ragged house-furnishings that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_284" title="284"> </a>
looked familiar&mdash;chairs, dishes, kitchen pans.
Amidst bundles of bedding and broken furniture
stood my mother. Oblivious of the curious
crowd, she lit the Sabbath candles and prayed
over them.</p>

<p>In a flash I understood it all. Because of the
loss of my wages while I was in the hospital,
we had been evicted for unpaid rent. It was
Sabbath eve. My father was in the synagogue
praying and my mother, defiant of disgrace,
had gone on with the ceremony of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>All the romance of our race was in the light
of those Sabbath candles. Homeless, abandoned
by God and man, yet in the very desolation of
the streets my mother’s faith burned&mdash;a challenge
to all America.</p>

<p>“Mammeh!” I cried, pushing through the
crowd. Bessie and Dave darted forward. In a
moment the four of us stood clinging to one
another, amid the ruins of our broken home.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>A neighbor invited us into her house for supper.
No sooner had we sat down at the table
than there was a knock at the door and a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_285" title="285"> </a>
square-figured young woman entered, asking
to see my mother.</p>

<p>“I am from the Social Betterment Society,”
she said. “I hear you’ve been dispossessed.
What’s the trouble here?”</p>

<p>“Oi weh! My bitter heart!” I yet see before
me the anguish of my mother’s face as she
turned her head away from the charity lady.</p>

<p>My father’s eyes sank to the floor. I could
feel him shrink in upon himself like one condemned.</p>

<p>The bite of food turned to gall in my throat.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in America? Where
were you born?” She questioned by rote, taking
out pad and pencil.</p>

<p>The silence of the room was terrible. The
woman who had invited us for supper slunk into
the bedroom, unable to bear our shame.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in America?”
repeated the charity lady.</p>

<p>Choked silence.</p>

<p>“Is there any one here who can speak?” She
translated her question into Yiddish.</p>

<p>“A black year on Gedalyeh Mindel, the liar!”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" title="286"> </a>
my mother burst out at last. “Why did we
leave our home? We were among our own. We
were people there. But what are we here? Nobodies&mdash;nobodies!
Cats and dogs at home
ain’t thrown in the street. Such things could
only happen in America&mdash;the land without a
heart&mdash;the land without a God!”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sakes! Is there any one here
intelligent enough to answer a straight question?”
The charity lady turned with disgusted
impatience from my mother to me. “Can you
tell me how long you have been in this country?
Where were you born?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!” I struck out
blindly, not aware of what I was saying.</p>

<p>“Why so bold? We are only trying to help
you and you are so resentful.”</p>

<p>“To the Devil with your help! I’m sick no
longer. I can take care of my mother&mdash;without
your charity!”</p>

<p>The next day I went back to the shop&mdash;to
the same long hours&mdash;to the same low wages&mdash;to
the same pig-eyed, fat-bellied boss. But
I was no longer the same. For the first time in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" title="287"> </a>
my life I bent to the inevitable. I accepted my
defeat. But something in me, stronger than I,
rose triumphant even in my surrender.</p>

<p>“Yes, I must submit to the shop,” I thought.
“But the shop shall not crush me. Only my
body I must sell into slavery&mdash;not my heart&mdash;not
my soul.</p>

<p>“To any one who sees me from without, I
am only a dirt-eating worm, a grub in the
ground, but I know that above this dark earth-place
in which I am sunk is the green grass&mdash;and
beyond the green grass, the sun and sky.
Alone, unaided, I must dig my way up to the
light!”</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Lunch-hour at the factory. My book of
Shelley’s poems before me and I was soon millions
of miles beyond the raucous voices of the
hungry eaters.</p>

<p>“Did you already hear the last news?”
Yetta tore my book from me in her excitement.</p>

<p>“What news?” I scowled at her for waking
me from my dreams.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have electricity by the machines.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_288" title="288"> </a>
And the forelady says that the new boss
will give us ten cents more on a dozen waists!”</p>

<p>“God from the world! How did it happen&mdash;electricity&mdash;better
pay?” I asked in amazement.
For that was the first I had heard of improved
conditions of work.</p>

<p>But little by little, step by step, the sanitation
improved. Open windows, swept floors,
clean wash-rooms, individual drinking-cups introduced
a new era of factory hygiene. Our
shop was caught up in the general movement
for social betterment that stirred the country.</p>

<p>It was not all done in a day. Weary years of
struggle passed before the workers emerged
from the each-for-himself existence into an organized
togetherness for mutual improvement.</p>

<p>At last, with the shortened hours of work, I
had enough vitality left at the end of the day to
join the night-school. Again my dream flamed.
Again America beckoned. In the school there
would be education&mdash;air, life for my cramped-in
spirit. I would learn to form the thoughts
that surged formless in me. I would find the
teacher that would make me articulate.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" title="289"> </a>Shelley was English literature.</p>

<p>So I joined the literature class. The course
began with the “De Coverley Papers.” Filled
with insatiate thirst, I drank in every line with
the feeling that any minute I would get to the
fountain-heart of revelation.</p>

<p>Night after night I read with tireless devotion.
But of what? The manners and customs
of the eighteenth century, of people two hundred
years dead.</p>

<p>One evening after a month’s attendance,
when the class had dwindled from fifty to four
and the teacher began scolding us who were left
for those who were absent, my bitterness broke.</p>

<p>“Do you know why all the girls are dropping
away from the class? It’s because they have
too much sense to waste themselves on the ‘De
Coverley Papers.’ Us four girls are four fools.
We could learn more in the streets. It’s dirty
and wrong, but it’s life. What are the ‘De Coverley
Papers’? Dry dust fit for the ash can.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better tell the board of
education your ideas of the standard classics,”
she scoffed, white with rage.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" title="290"> </a>“Classics? If all the classics are as dead as
the ‘De Coverley Papers,’ I’d rather read the
ads in the papers. How can I learn from this
old man that’s dead two hundred years how to
live my life?”</p>

<p>That was the first of many schools I had
tried. And they were all the same. A dull course
of study and the lifeless, tired teachers&mdash;no
more interested in their pupils than in the
wooden benches before them&mdash;chilled all my
faith in the American schools.</p>

<p>More and more the all-consuming need for a
friend possessed me. In the street, in the cars,
in the subways, I was always seeking, ceaselessly
seeking, for eyes, a face, the flash of a
smile that would be light in my darkness.</p>

<p>I felt sometimes that I was only burning out
my heart for a shadow, an echo, a wild dream.
But I couldn’t help it. Nothing was real to me
but my hope of finding a friend.</p>

<p>One day my sister Bessie came home much
excited over her new high-school teacher.
“Miss Latham makes it so interesting!” she
exclaimed. “She stops in the middle of the lesson
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" title="291"> </a>
and tells us things. She ain’t like a teacher.
She’s like a real person.”</p>

<p>At supper next evening, Bessie related more
wonder stories of her beloved teacher. “She’s
so different! She’s friends with us…. To-day,
when she gave us out our composition, Mamie
Cohen asked from what book we should read
up and she said, ‘Just take it out of your heart
and say it.’”</p>

<p>“Just take it out of your heart and say it.”
The simple words lingered in my mind, stirring
a whirl of hidden thoughts and feelings. It
seemed as if they had been said directly to me.</p>

<p>A few days later Bessie ran in from school, her
cheeks flushed, her eyes dancing with excitement.
“Give a look at the new poem teacher gave me
to learn!” It was a quotation from Kipling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Then only the Master shall praise us,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And only the Master shall blame,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And no one shall work for money,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And no one shall work for fame;<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">But each for the joy of the working,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And each in his separate Star,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Shall draw the thing as he sees it<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">For the God of things as they are.”<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" title="292"> </a>Only a few brief lines, but in their music the
pulses of my being leaped into life. And so it
was from day to day. Miss Latham’s sayings
kept turning themselves in my mind like a lingering
melody that could not be shaken off.
Something irresistible seemed to draw me to
her. She beckoned to me almost as strongly as
America had on the way over in the boat.</p>

<p>I wondered, “Should I go to see her and talk
myself out from my heart to her?</p>

<p>“Meshugeneh! Where&mdash;what? How come
you to her? What will you say for your reason?</p>

<p>“What’s the difference what I’ll say! I only
want to give a look on her&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>And so I kept on restlessly debating. Should
I follow my heart and go to her, or should I
have a little sense?</p>

<p>Finally the desire to see her became so strong
that I could no longer reason about it. I left the
factory in the middle of the day to seek her out.</p>

<p>All the way to her school I prayed: “God&mdash;God!
If I could only find one human soul that
cared&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>I found her bending over her desk. Her hair
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" title="293"> </a>
was gray, but she did not look tired like the
other teachers. She was correcting papers and
was absorbed in her task. I watched her, not
daring to interrupt. Presently she threw back
her head and gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>Then she saw me. “Why, how do you do?”
She rose. “Come and sit down.”</p>

<p>I felt she was as glad to see me as though she
had expected me.</p>

<p>“I feel you can help me,” I groped toward her.</p>

<p>“I hope I can.” She grasped my outstretched
hands and led me to a chair which seemed to be
waiting for me.</p>

<p>A strange gladness filled me.</p>

<p>“Bessie showed me the poem you told her to
learn&nbsp;…” I paused bewildered.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Her friendly eyes urged me to speak.</p>

<p>“From what Bessie told me I felt I could talk
myself out to you what’s bothering me.” I
stopped again.</p>

<p>She leaned forward with an inviting interest.
“Go on! Tell me all.”</p>

<p>“I’m an immigrant many years already
here, but I’m still seeking America. My dream
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" title="294"> </a>
America is more far from me than it was in the
old country. Always something comes between
the immigrant and the American,” I went on
blindly. “They see only his skin, his outside&mdash;not
what’s in his heart. They don’t care if he
has a heart…. I wanted to find some one that
would look on me&mdash;myself … I thought
you’d know yourself on a person first off.”</p>

<p>Abashed at my boldness I lowered my eyes
to the floor.</p>

<p>“Do go on … I want to hear.”</p>

<p>With renewed courage I continued my confessional.</p>

<p>“Life is too big for me. I’m lost in this
each-for-himself world. I feel shut out from
everything that’s going on…. I’m always
fighting&mdash;fighting&mdash;with myself and everything
around me…. I hate when I want to
love and I make people hate me when I want
to make them love me.”</p>

<p>She gave me a quick nod. “I know&mdash;I know
what you mean. Go on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what is with me the matter.
I’m so choked…. Sundays and holidays
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_295" title="295"> </a>
when the other girls go out to enjoy themselves,
I walk around by myself&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking….
My thoughts tear in me and I can’t
tell them to no one! I want to do something
with my life and I don’t know what.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came,” she said. And after a
pause, “You can help me.”</p>

<p>“Help you?” I cried. It was the first time
that an American suggested that I could help
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! I have always wanted to know
more of that mysterious vibrant life&mdash;the immigrant.
You can help me know my girls.”</p>

<p>The repression of centuries seemed to rush
out of my heart. I told her everything&mdash;of
the mud hut in Sukovoly where I was born, of
the Czar’s pogroms, of the constant fear of the
Cossack, of Gedalyeh Mindel’s letter and of
our hopes in coming to America.</p>

<p>After I had talked myself out, I felt suddenly
ashamed for having exposed so much, and I
cried out to her: “Do you think like the others
that I’m all wrapped up in self?”</p>

<p>For some minutes she studied me, and her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" title="296"> </a>
serenity seemed to project itself into me. And
then she said, as if she too were groping, “No&mdash;no&mdash;but
too intense.”</p>

<p>“I hate to be so all the time intense. But how
can I help it? Everything always drives me
back in myself. How can I get myself out into
the free air?”</p>

<p>“Don’t fight yourself.” Her calm, gray eyes
penetrated to the very soul in me. “You are
burning up too much vitality….</p>

<p>“You know some of us,” she went on&mdash;“not
many, unfortunately&mdash;have a sort of divine
fire which if it does not find expression
turns into smoke. This egoism and self-centeredness
which troubles you is only the smoke
of repression.”</p>

<p>She put her hand over mine. “You have had
no one to talk to&mdash;no one to share your
thoughts.”</p>

<p>I marveled at the simplicity with which she
explained me to myself. I couldn’t speak. I
just looked at her.</p>

<p>“But now,” she said, gently, “you have
some one. Come to me whenever you wish.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" title="297"> </a>“I have a friend,” it sang itself in me. “I
have a friend.”</p>

<p>“And you are a born American?” I asked.
There was none of that sure, all-right look of
the Americans about her.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! My mother, like so many
mothers,”&mdash;and her eyebrows lifted humorously
whimsical,&mdash;“claims we’re descendants
of the Pilgrim fathers. And that one of our
lineal ancestors came over in the Mayflower.”</p>

<p>“For all your mother’s pride in the Pilgrim
fathers, you yourself are as plain from the
heart as an immigrant.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t the Pilgrim fathers immigrants
two hundred years ago?”</p>

<p>She took from her desk a book called “Our
America,” by Waldo Frank, and read to me:
“We go forth all to seek America. And in the
seeking we create her. In the quality of our
search shall be the nature of the America that
we create.”</p>

<p>“Ach, friend! Your words are life to me! You
make it light for my eyes!”</p>

<p>She opened her arms to me and breathlessly I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_298" title="298"> </a>
felt myself drawn to her. Bonds seemed to
burst. A suffusion of light filled my being.
Great choirings lifted me in space.</p>

<p>I walked out unseeingly.</p>

<p>All the way home the words she read flamed
before me: “We go forth all to seek America.
And in the seeking we create her. In the quality
of our search shall be the nature of the America
that we create.”</p>

<p>So all those lonely years of seeking and praying
were not in vain! How glad I was that I
had not stopped at the husk&mdash;a good job&mdash;a
good living&mdash;but pressed on, through the
barriers of materialism.</p>

<p>Through my inarticulate groping and reaching-out
I had found the soul&mdash;the spirit&mdash;of
America!</p>
